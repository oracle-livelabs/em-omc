# Introduction

## About this workshop

In this workshop there are four tasks. They have been organized to help you become familiar with the use of this service's key capabilities: performing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SQL Performance Watch tasks. In this lab, we have simulated a hybrid environment, with external pluggable databases, so you do not have to setup or use one of your own databases.

Estimated Workshop Time: 30 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SQL Performance Watch (OCI SQL Performance Watch)

As a DevOps user or Database Administrator, you can use the OCI SQL Performance Watch service to monitor and manage your Oracle Databases. The SQL Performance Watch service supports Oracle Databases located on-premises and connected to a resource in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure External Database service (referred to as External Oracle Databases).

SQL Performance Watch supports Oracle Database versions 11.2.0.4 and later. Using the SQL Performance Watch service you can:

* Proactively manage system change-related performance challenges for optimal database health
* Perform comprehensive workload analysis by running SQL statements in isolation with production system optimizer context and binds before and after the changes
* Identify SQL statements that have had their performance regress, improve, or not be impacted by the change
* Generate SPA reports for performance analysis and find regressions 

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Identify SQL statements that have had their performance regress
* Review the SQL Performance Analyzer(SPA) report, analyzing at metric level such as CPU, IO, Reads, Write etc.,.
* Review the SPA report of upgrade use case of database from 19.3 to 19.26 DB version
* Review the SPA report of adding new indexes use case in a database
