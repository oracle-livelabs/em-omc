# Capacity Planning of Oracle Exadata

## Introduction

In this lab, you will go through the steps to explore the Capacity Planning of Oracle Exadata.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

-   Explore Capacity Planning Oracle Exadata.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Lab: Enable Demo Mode

## Task 1: Exadata Insights

1.  On the **Overview** page, click on **Exadata Insights** from the left pane.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exadata-insights-ocw.png " ")

2.  This will show the Exadata systems registered for Ops Insights.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exadata-systems-ocw.png " ")

3.  On this page, the aggregate view of all the discovered Exadata systems will be shown.

      ![Left Pane](./images/aggregate-view-ocw.png " ")

4.  Also, the current and forecast utilization of the Exadata system will be shown in the bottom section. Click on an Exadata system to evaluate more insights. Click on the Full Rack **X8-2\_Full_DBM08.us.oracle.com**.

      ![Left Pane](./images/current-forecast-ocw.png " ")

5.  On the **Exadata System Details** page, you can view **Rack and Key Metrics**. The page displays Software and Hardware Summary.

      ![Left Pane](./images/rack-and-key-metrics-ocw.png " ")

6.  Navigate to **Metrics by Database** on the left pane.

      ![Left Pane](./images/metrics-by-database-ocw.png " ")

7.  Select the **CPU** tab and choose **Host** under Grouping.

      ![Left Pane](./images/metrics-by-database-host-ocw.png " ")

8.  Now choose **Allocation (CPU)** under **Size** and **Usage Change (%)** under **Color**.

      ![Left Pane](./images/max-allocation-usage-change-ocw.png " ")

9.  To show the trend & forecast of CPU for Host and Database, click on the hostname and highlight the trend graph.

      ![Left Pane](./images/trend-host-cpu-ocw.png " ")

      We see the aggregate CPU demand of the 3 databases is very stable at the host-level. At the database-level, 2 have growing demand and one is shrinking.

10.  Select the database and highlight the trend and forecast graph.

      ![Left Pane](./images/trend-host-database-ocw.png " ")

11.  To view **Unused CPU capacity** within your database resources navigate to **Metrics by database**. Under **Grouping** select **Host**. Choose **Usage (avg. active CPU)** under **Size** and **Utilization (%)** under **Color**.

      Selecting one of these will allow you to checkmark the **Show Unused Capacity** check.
      Once the **Show Unused Capacity** has been checked, a gray bar will appear on the treemap showing the unused space. 
      
      You can additionally expand the treemap for a better visualization, as well as view the treemap squarified, vertical, or horiziontal. Unused capacity will be grouped by vertically default.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exa-unused-host.png " ")

      Under **Grouping** select **VM cluster**.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exa-unused-vmcluster.png " ")

12.  Click **Metrics by Host** on the left pane.

      ![Left Pane](./images/metrics-by-host-ocw.png " ")

13.  On the **Metrics by Host** page, click on the **CPU** tab, select **All hosts** to see the aggregate trend & forecast. 

      ![Left Pane](./images/cpu-all-hosts-ocw.png " ")

14.  Click the **Exadata Storage Server** option on the left pane.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exadata-storage-server-ocw.png " ")

15. Select **Individual data series** on the top right pane to show the individual storage utilization.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exadata-storage-server1-ocw.png " ")

16. Select **Aggregate data series and forecast** on the top right pane to show total individual storage utilization.

      ![Left Pane](./images/exadata-storage-server2.png " ")

In Conclusion, OPSI Exadata Insights provides comprehensive capacity analysis to give administrators the ability to view, analyze, proactively forecast, and detect potential constraints in Exadata resources. As a system administrator they want to be able to make critical decisions to optimize their Exadata stacks; plan for growth, compare resource usage and perform what-if analysis for various scenarios.
