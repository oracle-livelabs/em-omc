3.  On the **Complete prerequisites** pop-up click on **Apply**. When enabling demo mode, a policy is created to allow read-only access to the demo tenancy's data. It may take up to 1 or 2 minutes for the policy to allow data access across the tenancies.  If you are receiving authorization errors you may need to refresh the page until they have cleared, or you will need to engage an administrator or user with elevated privileges to create the policy.

4.  Click **Close** after the policy has been created.

5.  Once the mode is enabled the overview page will now show resource information for the OperationsInsights compartment, notice the upper-right hand corner will show Demo Mode is now ON for your session.  When you would like to exit demo mode you can either click the disable link in the corner or click the now present **Disable Demo Mode** button where you initially enabled it on the overview page.
