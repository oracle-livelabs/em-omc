### About Ops Insights

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ops Insights is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) native service that provides holistic insight into database and host resource utilization and capacity.  Ops Insights (OPSI) provides capacity planning, long-term SQL analysis, and historical performance reports for your Oracle databases. The service has a full offering of features to improve performance and reduce overhead for your resources. The ability to quickly and easily ingest valuable metric data allows administrators, engineers, and executives to make informed decisions on allocating resources to prevent major issues and reduce overhead for managing their infrastructure resources.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Ops Insights enables administrators to uncover performance issues, forecast consumption, and plan capacity using machine-learning-based analytics on historical and SQL data. Organizations can use these capabilities to make data-driven decisions to optimize resource use, proactively avoid outages, and improve performance.

Ops Insights consists of the following integrated applications:

Capacity Planning

* Utilization, analysis and forecasting for database and host resources.
* Analyze and forecast resource usage based on long-term historical data.
* Optimize cost of operations by identifying under and overutilized databases and hosts.

Exadata Insights

* Enterprise-wide analysis of resource utilization, capacity planning for Exadata.
* Improve resource utilization by identifying under and overutilized resources.
* Identify Exadata systems projected to reach high utilization.

SQL Warehouse

* Long-term SQL store for performance and trend analysis of Oracle Databases.
* Proactively identify and mitigate SQL issues.
* Find common patterns in SQL behaviour across databases and applications.

AWR Hub

* Track and analyze SQL plan changes for workloads within a single database.
* Track and analyze SQL plan changes for workloads across multiple databases.
* Understand past and present workload (SQL) performance over two years or above.
* Build custom dashboards to plot SQL performance statistics, database waits, CPU usage history, connections established, etc.

AWR Explorer

* View and analyze AWR data across different database systems.
* Easily identify performance trends without needing to toggle between hourly AWR reports.
* Visualize different aspects of Oracle Database performance data which can be helpful in detecting performance issues.

SQL Explorer

* Interactively explore and visualize detailed performance statistics stored in Ops Insights SQL Warehouse.
* Explore performance statistics via a SQL query to extract the data with which to create an intuitive visualization.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Enable Demo Mode for Ops Insights.
