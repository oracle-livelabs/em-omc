# Lab 4 - Monitor End-to-End Purchase Order Flow with Oracle Log Analytics

## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to monitor and troubleshoot the complete Purchase Order (PO) business flow from Oracle Fusion ERP Cloud through Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) to Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) using Oracle Log Analytics. You will learn to correlate logs across multiple Oracle Cloud services, track business identifiers, and visualize the entire PO flow to detect bottlenecks and failure points.

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Understand Oracle Log Analytics concepts including visualizations and dashboards
- Correlate logs across Fusion Applications, OIC, and Database using transaction identifiers and event timestamps
- Visualize the entire PO flow and detect bottlenecks or failure points
- Learn how logs support dependency analysis for business process monitoring
- Track PO business identifiers (PO Header ID, Order Number, Supplier, Status) across all systems

## Task 1: End-to-End Purchase Order Flow Monitoring and Tracing Strategy

### Oracle SaaS Fusion and Integration Components telemetry

The following components generate logs that are crucial for end-to-end observability:

| Component | Observability Log Source | Functional Components | Upstream and Downstream Systems | Ingestion method | 
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Oracle SaaS Fusion Apps** | Fusion Audit Logs, User Activity, ESS job requests | ESS Audit, User Activity Audit, Fusion Audit, ESS job requests, Business Objects Audit | OIC via REST/SOAP | Fusion REST API endpoints based log ingestion via Management Agent| 
| **Oracle Integration Cloud** | OIC Activity Stream Logs | integration execution, B2B processing | SaaS ERP Cloud, ADW, APEX | Service Logs via Service Connector |
| **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse** | Business data in table/view, Database Audit Logs | Data persistence, analytics queries, access patterns | OIC, APEX | Database SQL connector based log ingestion via Management Agent |
| **Oracle APEX Application** | User Activity, Application Usage, Error Logs | User Success and Failed Logins, Application and User Activity, Application Errors | ADW, OIC | Database connector based log ingestion via Management Agent |

### Monitoring and Log Correlation Strategy

**Key Correlation and Tracking Field**
- **Primary business identifier across all systems**
    - PO Header Id
    - Order Number
    - Trading Partner ID
    - Document Status
- **Technical correlation for integration flows**
    - Transaction ID
    - OPC Request ID
- **Timestamp** to track chronological ordering of events across components

## Task 2: Find the Purchase Order information

### Use APEX app to check the Real-Time Purchase Order information

- Follow the APEX app [AI World 25 Fusion Purchase Order Demo](https://ep8c8t82piuc9mv-ligiq4h13k1nhb8s.adb.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/r/vector/sample-interactive-grids103/home)
- On the Home page, note down the **POHeaderId** and **OrderNumber** for the most recent purchase orders
