# Lab 3 - Monitor individual components

## Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the various dashboards available in Oracle for monitoring Fusion Applications, Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), and Oracle Database (DB). These dashboards offer a unified and centralized view of log data, allowing users to efficiently monitor system health, analyze performance, and troubleshoot issues across Fusion Applications, OIC integrations, and database instances.

Estimated Time: 5  minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will get an overview of the different dashboards, including their usage and the various widgets provided within each dashboard.

## Task 1: Dashboard Navigation
