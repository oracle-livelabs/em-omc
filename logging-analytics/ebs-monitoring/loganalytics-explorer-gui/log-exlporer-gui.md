Around 14 different types of logs (Log Sources) are being collected in Logging Analytics ranging from logs from Oracle Database to Linux OS to Packaged Applications to Cloud Services.

Note: You are working with live logs so it may take a few minutes for logs to show up in your Log Explorer view. Click the **Run** button to re-run the query.

You'll learn log analytics basics and how to use Log Explorer GUI in the next section.
