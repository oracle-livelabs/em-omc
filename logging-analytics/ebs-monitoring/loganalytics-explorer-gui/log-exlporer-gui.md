Let's do a walk through of Log Explorer, which should be the current view on OCI Console.

You should see a page similar to the one below showing the distribution of different types of logs currently being collected in this tenancy in the last 60 minutes.

Around 800+ different types of logs (Log Sources) are being collected in Logging Analytics ranging from logs from Oracle Database to Linux OS to Packaged Applications to Cloud Services.

Note: You are working with live logs so it may take a few minutes for logs to show up in your Log Explorer view. Click the **Run** button to re-run the query.

You'll learn log analytics basics and how to use Log Explorer GUI in the next section.
