# Lab concluded

We built a solid foundation for efficiently monitoring complex IT systems using Oracle Logging Analytics. We learned how to do basic log analytics and use advance ML analytics techniques for identifying and troubleshooting issues.

### Next Steps

In last 70 minutes we covered on a handful of Logging Analytics features with the goals of ensuring that participants can explore and use the product on their own with confidence. We suggest the following as next steps:

* Create scheduled search alert to notify your team when an issue is identified
* Create an Enterprise level dashboard to monitor top KPIs for your entire IT environment in a single pane of glass

Below are a few resources to get you started.
