# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop learn how to use OCI Logging Analytics in a pre-configured environment to easily perform such tasks, including outlier detection, event clustering, log correlation and anomaly detection.

A typical enterprise environment has massive volume of log telemetry. Finding interesting log data and events and correlating them to a specific business flow from across all your applications, or identifying abnormal behavior can be challenging.  

OCI Logging Analytics is a cloud solution that aggregates, indexes, and analyzes a variety of log data from on-premises and multi-cloud environments. It enables you to search, explore, and correlate this data, derive operational insights and make informed decisions.  

Estimated Workshop Time: 30 minutes
