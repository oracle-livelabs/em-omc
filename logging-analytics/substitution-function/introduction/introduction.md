# Substitution Function Overview
## Introduction

The Substitution function enrichment plays a crucial role in enhancing log data by dynamically modifying field values during log processing. It allows businesses to replace portions of a field value or standardize data by applying alternative values or expressions. These transformed values can then be stored in a new output field, ensuring consistency and improving data enrichment.

Estimated Workshop Time: 45 minutes
