# Substitution Function Overview
## Introduction

Sources define the location of your entity's logs and how to enrich the log entries. You can use the source to start continuous log collection through the OCI management agents. Incase you want to ingest log files into Oracle Logging Analytics without continuously collecting them using the Management Agent, then you can perform an on-demand upload. 

Oracle Logging Analytics lets you configure Field Enrichment options within a source so you can further extract and display meaningful information from your uploaded logs. Substitution option is used to replace a string/expression in a field with an alternative expression and store the result in an output field.

This live lab will cover updating a source with a substitution function as the type of field enrichment option. It will also take you through the steps for visualizing the data in log explorer.

Estimated Workshop Time: 30 minutes
