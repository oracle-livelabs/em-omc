In this lab, you'll familarize yourself with OCI Management Agent service and related pages in OCI Console. Management Agent is used for collecting metrics from Kubernetes environment in Kubernetes Monitoring Solution.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes
### Objectives

In this lab, you will get familiarized with:
* Navigating to Management Agent Service
* Navigating to the Agent Home Page to view its health
* (Optional) Generating an Install Key for use with Management Agents
* (Optional) Downloading an Install Key file


## Task 1:  Navigating to Management Agent Service

To navigate to the Management Agent Service, follow one of the below two methods.

1. From Navigation Menu ![navigation-menu](images/navigation-menu.png) > **Observability & Management** > **Management Agent** > **Overview**.

    ```
         <copy>

## Task 3:  (Optional) Generating an Install Key for use with Management Agents
The following task is optional for this lab as the install key is generated by the Resource Manager stack.  If you are installing the agent outside the lab environment then you will need to generate the install key as shown here.

Install Key is needed to register the agent with Management Agent Cloud Service.  The key lets the Management Agent Cloud Service know  how many agents are permitted to be installed.  The key can be made restritive: to allow a certain number of agents within a set number of days or can be made unrestricted (unlimited). This key is used only once by the Management Agent during the registration process. 

**Note:** The install key is only used for registration.  Once the agent is installed using a key, the agent functionality is not affected even if the install key expires.

1. **Key name** to use for the Install key.

2. **Compartment** picker to choose the compartment to use for the Management Agents.

3. **Maximum Installations** to limit the Management Agents that can be installed using this install key.

4. **Valid for** to pick the duration for which Management Agents installations will be allowed using this install key.

5. **Unlimited** checkbox to make this install key unrestricted which will allow unlimited agent installations and the install key will not expire.

## Task 4:  (Optional) Download Install Key File
The following task is optional for this lab as the install key is generated by the Resource Manager stack.  If you are installing the agent outside the lab environment then you will need to generate the install key as shown here.

1. The install key that was created in Task 2 can be downloaded and provided to the agent during installation.
