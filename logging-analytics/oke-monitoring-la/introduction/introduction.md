# Introduction

## About this Workshop
Kubernetes provides a highly robust and extremely customizable platform for managing automatically deploying and scaling containerized workloads. Building a monitoring and troubleshooting system for this entire environment is a very challenging task. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Logging Analytics bridges this monitoring gap by providing a one-click end-to-end Kubernetes monitoring solution for the underlying infrastructure, Kubernetes platform and cloud-native applications.

This live lab will cover setting up this end-to-end Kubernetes Monitoring Solution, performing the Analytics and Visualising the data from different perspectives.

Estimated Workshop Time: 01 hours 30 minutes
