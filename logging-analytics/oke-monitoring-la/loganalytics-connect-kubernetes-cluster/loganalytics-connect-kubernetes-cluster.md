  - Understanding the current state of the Kubernetes Cluster
  - Visualizing the data in different views Cluster, Workload,  Node & Pod 


## Task 1: Navigating to cluster

## Task 2: Understanding current state of the cluster from summary panel: Namespaces, Nodes, Workloads and types, pods

## Task 3: Using topologies to understand logical and network relationships 

## Task 4: Using filters on four tabs and understand changes on telemetry data

## Task 5: Understanding and using key log widgets from panel: events widget, k8s platform, nodes, compute, LB, VCN
