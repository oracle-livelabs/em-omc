# Enable application monitoring using Observability and Management Services

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll enable OCI Logging Analytics Service to monitor Oracle Kubernetes Engine and OCI Application Performance Management (APM) for application monitoring and also OCI Database Management for monitoring MySQL HeatWave Database to get end to end visibility of the application and its stack. 

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will see step-by-step instructions to:
  - Enable APM & Logging Analytics Service
  - Complete visibility into the application using O&M Services 

## Task 1: Monitor MySQL HeatWave Database 

1. From the OCI menu, select **Observability & Management** -> **Database Management** then **MySQL HeatWave**.

5. Performing MySQL HeatWave DB System Performance Diagnostics

  - Click on **Performance Hub** tab 
    ![Oracle Cloud console Menu](images/4-0-5-dbm.png " ")
  
  - Performance Hub provides holistic performance management capabilities providing a single view of the database performance using a varied set of features, such as Active statement latency, statement count charts, top 100 queries sorted by metrics, and the ability to drill down into specific SQL details.

    ![Oracle Cloud console Menu](images/4-0-6-dbm.png " ")

  - Click on one of the top query **UPDATE 'A1P_USERS'** to see the performance of the query 

    ![Oracle Cloud console Menu](images/4-0-7-dbm.png " ")

    Total of 8 executions and all 8 executions got failed. This allows us to quickly identify the database query performance issues using OCI Database Management Service. 

## Task 2: Create an APM domain

1.	From the OCI menu, select **Observability & Management** -> **Application Performance Monitoring** then **Administration**.

    - find **auto\_generated\_private_data\_key**. 
    - find **auto\_generated\_public_data\_key**. 

   Copy data upload endpoint and data keys (private and public) to a file to be used in later tasks in the workshop. 

  ![Oracle Cloud console, APM Domain](images/5-1-6-apmdomain.png " ")


## Task 4: Enable APM for the **Wine Cellar** application

1. Enable APM using K8 Open telemetry operator at the namespace

    - Update field **<apm-endpoint>** (line 11) with APM upload end point obtained from task 2. 
    - Update field **<apm-private-data-key>** (line 13) with private data key obtained from task 2. 


    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd ~/oci-devlive-2024/sb-hol
    vi customapmresource.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-2-appmon.png " ")

    - Press the Esc key to ensure you are in command mode.
    - Type :wq (colon followed by wq) in the vi editor.
    - Press Enter to execute the command to save the file 

3. Running **enableapm.sh** enables APM for the Kubernetes cluster

    enableapm.sh 
    - Installs required libraries to enable K8 Open Telemetry operator 
    - Maps K8 Open Telemetry operator to inject APM java agent 
    - Injects APM java agent at the K8 namespace level through the K8 operator 

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd ~/oci-devlive-2024/sb-hol
    ./enableapm.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-3-appmon.png " ")


4. Verify if the APM is enabled by executing the below command and check for OTEL parameters in the pod parameters. 

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get pod wstore-front-0 -o yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-4-appmon.png " ")
    Now the APM is enabled for the application proceed to the next task. 

## Task 5: Generate workload by navigating to the app

1.  Click **Login**.

    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/4-1-1-wstore.png " ")


2.  Enter your name (or john) as username, leave the password blank, and click **Login**.

    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/4-1-2-wstore.png " ")


3. Then click around the buttons in the pages, as in the example flow shown below.

    >**Note:** Do not worry if you see the "Failed" messages, or if it takes a long time for the pages to respond. Those are expected because the app is designed to fail every once and often for demo purposes.

    Click **Add** on a couple of products then hit **Shopping Cart**. Then Click **Checkout**.
    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/4-1-3-wstore.png " ")
    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/4-1-4-wstore.png " ")

    Click **Confirm Order**.

    Click **Logout**.
    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/4-1-6-wstore.png " ")


## Task 6: Examine traces in APM Trace Explorer

1. From the OCI menu, select **Observability & Management** > **Trace Explorer**

   ![Oracle Cloud, Navigation Menu](images/5-1-1-traces.png " ")

2. On the Trace Explorer page, select **devlive24** for the **Compartment** and **apm-appdev** for the **APM Domain**.

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-2-traces.png " ")

3.	By default, traces are displayed in the order by the start time. Right mouse click on the **Duration** column, select **Sort Descending** to show the traces by duration in descending order. This will bring the slowest trace to the top of the list.

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-3-traces.png " ")

4. Hover the mouse over the bar in the **Spans** column at the top row. Verify three services are included in the trace, and each color represents a service: wstore-back, wstore-front, and wstore-web

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-4-0-traces.png " ")

5.	Click the trace link at the **Service:Operationame** column.

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-4-1-traces.png " ")

   >**Note:** If you do not see a slow trace with a duration of 10 seconds or more, you can navigate the WineStore demo app a few times until you see the programmed slowness in the checkout service.

6. **Trace Details** page opens. Review the trace information on the upper screen. E.g., Status, Trace ID, Whether it has an error or not, how many spans and services are involved, or the duration of the trace.
   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-5-traces.png " ")

7. In the **Topology** view, you can see how the operations are connected within the trace. Different colors indicate different services. Hover the mouse on the icons and the arrows that connect the icons. Review the information in the callouts.
  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-6-traces.png " ")

  >**Note:** The operations may look differently in the trace you selected.

8. Scroll down the page to show the **Spans** view. Spans in the trace are displayed in a Gantt chart. A span at the top of the list is the root span, and the child spans are nested below the root span.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-7-traces.png " ")

9. **Trace Details** shows one span error and find the span that has errored, now lets click on that span to understand the reason for the error. 

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/5-1-8-traces.png " ")

Span error message shows that the table **A1P_USERS** is missing in the wine database which resulted in the error in this particular trace.

 >**Note:** With APM its easy to query the trace and span data using the trace query language and explore other tabs (Users, SQLs, Web Apps, Sessions, etc..) in trace explorer to get quick insights into application performance.
