1.	Click the link to the APM domain.
  ![Oracle Cloud console, APM Domain](images/5-1-5-apmdomain.png " ")



2. In the **APM Domain Information** tab, find **Data Upload Endpoint**
  - Under **Resources**, click **Data Keys**.
    - find **auto\_generated\_private_data\_key**. 
    - find **auto\_generated\_public_data\_key**. 

   Copy data upload endpoint and data keys (private and public) to a file to be used in later tasks in the workshop. 

  ![Oracle Cloud console, APM Domain](images/5-1-6-apmdomain.png " ")


## Task 3: Enable APM for the **Wine Cellar** application

1. Enable APM browser agent by updating APM upload endpoint and public data key in the **wstore.yaml**

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    vi wstore.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
    - Update fields **<apm-endpoint>** (line 55) and **<apm-public-data-key>** (line 57) with APM upload end point and data keys obtained from task 2. 

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-1-appmon.png " ")

    - Press the Esc key to ensure you are in command mode.
    - Type :wq (colon followed by wq) in the vi editor.
    - Press Enter to execute the command to save the file 

2. Enable APM using K8 Open telemetry operator at the namespace

    - Update fields **<apm-endpoint>** (line 11) and **<apm-private-data-key>** (line 13) with APM upload end point and data keys obtained from task 2. 

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd ~/sb-hol;vi customapmresource.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-2-appmon.png " ")

    - Press the Esc key to ensure you are in command mode.
    - Type :wq (colon followed by wq) in the vi editor.
    - Press Enter to execute the command to save the file 

3. Apply **wstore.yaml**, **customapmresource.yaml**, **apmnamespace.yaml** to the Kubernetes cluster to enable APM for the application in the order mentioned below. 

   - To enable K8 Open Telemetry operator 
    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.3/cert-manager.yaml 
    </copy>
    ```

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

   - Map K8 Open Telemetry operator to inject APM java agent 
    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/customapmresource.yaml --validate=false
    </copy>
    ```

   - Inject APM java agent at the K8 namespace level 
    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/apmnamespace.yaml --validate=false
    </copy>
    ```

   - Enable browser agent
    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/wstore.yaml --validate=false
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-4-appmon.png " ")
    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-3-5-appmon.png " ")


    Now the APM is enabled for the application proceed to the next task. 

## Task 4: Generate workload by navigating to the app

1.  Click **Login**.

    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/6-1-2-wstore.png " ")


2.  Enter your name (or john) as username, leave the password blank, and click **Login**.

    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/6-1-4-demoapp.png " ")


3. Then click around the buttons in the pages, as in the example flow shown below.

    >**Note:** Do not worry if you see the "Failed" messages, or if it takes a long time for the pages to respond. Those are expected because the app is designed to fail every once and often for demo purposes.

    Click **Add** on a couple of products then hit **Shopping Cart**. Then Click **Checkout**.
    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/6-1-5-demoapp.png " ")
    Click **Confirm Order**, then **Logout**.
    ![WineCellar Demo App](images/6-1-6-demoapp.png " ")


## Task 5: Examine traces in APM Trace Explorer

1. From the OCI menu, select **Observability & Management** > **Trace Explorer**

   ![Oracle Cloud, Navigation Menu](images/6-2-1-menu.png " ")

2. On the Trace Explorer page, select **apmworkshop** for the **Compartment** and the **APM Domain**.

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-2-traceexplorer.png " ")

3.	By default, traces are displayed in the order by the start time. Right mouse click on the **Duration** column, select **Sort Descending** to show the traces by duration in descending order. This will bring the slowest trace to the top of the list.

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-3-traceexplorer.png " ")

4. Hover the mouse over the bar in the **Spans** column at the top row. Verify three services are included in the trace, and each color represents a service, wstore-back, wstore-front, and wstore-web, which you defined in the previous labs.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-4-traceexplorer.png " ")

5.	Click the trace link at the **Service:Operationame** column.

   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-5-traceexplorer.png " ")

   >**Note:** If you do not see a slow trace with a duration of 10 seconds or more, you can navigate the WineStore demo app a few times until you see the programmed slowness in the checkout service.

6. **Trace Details** page opens. Review the trace information on the upper screen. E.g., Status, Trace ID, Whether it has an error or not, how many spans and services are involved, or the duration of the trace.
   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-6-traceexplorer.png " ")

7. In the **Topology** view, you can see how the operations are connected within the trace. Different colors indicate different services. Hover the mouse on the icons and the arrows that connect the icons. Review the information in the callouts.
  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-7-traceexplorer.png " ")

  In this example, it seems that the checkout service is where the most time was spent in the trace.

  >**Note:** The operations may look differently in the trace you selected.

8. Scroll down the page to show the **Spans** view. Spans in the trace are displayed in a Gantt chart. A span at the top of the list is the root span, and the child spans are nested below the root span.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-8-traceexplorer.png " ")

  In this example, one of the operations is taking 9 seconds alone, out of the total duration of 10 seconds. This seems to be the bottleneck of the slowness.


## Task 6: Enable Logging Analytics Service
