# Deploy the Application

## Introduction

Now that the infrastructure is up and running, it's time to deploy the app and see it all come together. We demonstrated how easy it is to deploy a Java app with MySQL HeatWave Database as backend and deploy on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE). In this lab, you will prepare MySQL HeatWave Database with application schema and then deploy the Java Application to Kubernetes cluster created in Lab 1.

Estimated time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

* Connect to the OKE Cluster
* Prepare the MySQL HeatWave Database
* Deploy the application

### Prerequisites

* Completion of the preceding labs in this workshop.

## Task 1: Connect to Kubernetes

1. Export the `kubeconfig` variable to enable communication to your new OKE cluster. **Note**: During the Terraform execution process, the `kubeconfig` file was automatically retrieved and stored in a project subfolder. 

      ```bash
      <copy>
      cd ~/oci-devlive-2024
      export KUBECONFIG=~/oci-devlive-2024/deployment/terraform/generated/kubeconfig
      </copy>
      ```

      > If the console closes, remember to rerun this command.
   
2. Check that Kubernetes is up and running and you can talk to the Control Plane API endpoint by listing the nodes.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      kubectl get nodes
      </copy>
      ```

      ```bash
      $ kubectl get nodes
      NAME          STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
      10.0.156.59   Ready    node    3d    v1.28.2
      ```

## Task 2: Prepare Database for the application

1. Deploy an OKE Pod containing the MySQL client that will be used to connect to the DB System.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      kubectl run mysql-client --image=iad.ocir.io/axfo51x8x2ap/load-mysql-data:latest -it --rm --restart=Never -- /bin/bash
      </copy>
      ```

      ![Kubectl command](images/2-2-1-buildapp.png " ")

2. Execute the command below to connect to the MySQL HeatWave Database using the Private IP address of the database and the credentials provided when the DB System was created.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      mysql -h <mds-private-ip-address> -u <mds-admin-user> -p
      </copy>
      ```

      ![Kubectl command](images/2-2-2-buildapp.png " ")

3. Execute the command below to create a **`WINE`** application database with required tables.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      source insert_100_mysql.sql
      </copy>
      ```

      ![Kubectl command](images/2-2-3-buildapp.png " ")

4. Type **exit** to leave the MySQL client, then **exit** once more to leave and terminate the MySQL Client pod.

      ![Kubectl command](images/2-2-4-buildapp.png " ")


## Task 3: Deploy the application

1. Navigate to the app deployment folder.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      cd ~/oci-devlive-2024/sb-hol
      </copy>
      ```

2. Verify the contents of the **sb-hol** directory.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      ls -l
      </copy>
      ```

      ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-3-1-buildapp.png " ")

      >**Note:** Verify the follwoing files are present in the folder
      * admessage.yaml
      * apmnamespace.yaml
      * customapmresource.yaml
      * enableapm.sh
      * wstore.yaml

3. Modify the file **wstore.yaml** to update the MySQL HeatWave Database Private IP

      ```bash
      <copy>
      cd ~/oci-devlive-2024/sb-hol
      vi wstore.yaml
      </copy>
      ```

    - Update field **<mds-private-ip-address>** with MySQL HeatWave Database Private IP (line 84) 

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-3-2-buildapp.png " ")

    - Press the Esc key to ensure you are in command mode.
    - Type :wq (colon followed by wq) in the vi editor.
    - Press Enter to execute the command to save the file 

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-3-3-buildapp.png " ")

4. Execute the command below to deploy to the application cluster.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      kubectl apply -f wstore.yaml
      </copy>
      ```

## Task 4: Launch the application

1. Verify the 2 services and 2 statefule sets are created successfully

      ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-4-1-0-buildapp.png " ")

2. Run the `kubectl` command below to display the status of the pod creation. Wait until all pods are in the 'Running' state. This might take a minute or two.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      kubectl get pods
      </copy>
      ```

      ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-4-1-1-buildapp.png " ")

3. Retrieve the public IP address for the application service endpoint. Copy it into a text file for future use.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      kubectl get svc
      </copy>
      ```

      ![OCI Console, Cloud Shell, kubectl results](images/2-4-2-buildapp.png " ")

4. Refer to the example below and construct a URL, then paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. If you see the WineCellar content as illustrated in the screenshot below, deployment was successfull.

      ```bash
      <copy>
      http://<IP of the wstore-frontend service>/winestore/
      </copy>
      ```

      ![Wine cellar demo app](images/2-4-3-buildapp.png " ")

      >**Note:** It may take a few minutes to complete the deployment and start loading the page content on the screen for the first time.
