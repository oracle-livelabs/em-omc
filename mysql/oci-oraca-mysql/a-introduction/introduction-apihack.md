# Introduction

## About this Challenge

Get ready to revolutionize the application's advertising game! Join the Ad Mastery Challenge to build a dynamic ad messages API and integrate it into the application's interface. In this challenge, discover how Oracle makes it easier to build and deploy cloud-native applications in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Learn how to effortlessly develop applications using the code editor in OCI, and then deploy them using Kubernetes. And since every app needs a database, why not leverage Oracleâ€™s managed MySQL HeatWave Database to simplify deployment and management tasks?. This workshop guides you through the process of provisioning a MySQL HeatWave database on OCI, enhancing a Spring Boot application, and deploying the application on an Oracle Kubernetes cluster.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes
