# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop consists of three lab exercises organized to familiarize you with key capabilities of Oracle Cloud services, including Database Management, Ops Insights and Logging Analytics. We have simulated HeatWave MySQL DB systems, so you don't need to set up or use one from your cloud account.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

* Use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Database Management to monitor the HeatWave MySQL DB systems
* Use Ops Insights for Capacity Planning and Database Insights
* Use Logging Analytics to collect and analyze database logs, such as the General Query log, Audit log, and others

## Task 1: Heatwave MySQL Database

Heatwave MySQL is a fully-managed database service powered by the integrated HeatWave in-memory query accelerator. It is the only cloud-native database service that combines transactions, analytics, and machine learning services into Heatwave MySQL, delivering real-time, secure analytics without the complexity, latency, and cost of ETL duplication.

## Task 2: Observability and Management Services

Oracle Cloud **Observability and Management Platform** provides full-stack visibility, prebuilt analytics, and automation to monitor, analyze, and manage multicloud applications and infrastructure environments.

* Database Management

    Database management provides a unified console for managing both cloud and on-premises databases. It includes lifecycle database management capabilities for monitoring, performance tuning, and administration. With Performance Hub, developers can optimize SQL code during active development and continuously monitor and tune queries in production.

* Ops Insights

    OCI Ops Insights (OPSI) is a cloud-native solution that gathers and analyzes telemetry data to help enterprises plan for growth. It enables data-driven capacity planning and performance management, reducing capital expenditures and improving application throughput. It supports ML-based resource usage trending, capacity planning, and Data Explorer-based performance analysis, all within an intuitive dashboard.

* Logging Analytics

    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Logging Analytics is a cloud solution that lets you index, enrich, aggregate, explore, search, analyze, correlate, visualize and monitor log data from applications and system infrastructure-both in the cloud and on-premises. It can extract database instance records based on SQL queries provided in the log source configuration. In this lab, you'll learn how to use the Oracle Cloud Logging Analytics to enrich log data collected from the world's most popular open source database-MySQL.
