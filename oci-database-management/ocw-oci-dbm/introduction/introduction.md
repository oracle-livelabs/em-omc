# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop there are 6 tasks. They have been organized to help you become familiar with the use of this service's key capabilities: performing common Database Management tasks using the Oracle Cloud. In this lab, we have simulated a hybrid environment, with autonomous, cloud, and external pluggable databases, so you do not have to setup or use one of your own databases.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Management (OCI Database Management)

As a DevOps user or Database Administrator, you can use the OCI Database Management service to monitor and manage your Oracle Databases. The Database Management service supports Oracle Databases located on-premises and connected to a resource in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure External Database service (referred to as External Oracle Databases). Database Management service also supports Oracle Autonomous Databases, Oracle Databases in third-party cloud environments (multi-cloud), and Oracle Cloud Databases, which are Oracle Databases on the following Co-managed Oracle Database Cloud solutions:
-	Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems
-	Exadata Cloud Service

Database Management supports Oracle Database versions 11.2.0.4 and later. Using the Database Management service you can:

* Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of all your Oracle Databases together (Fleet of databases).
* Use Performance Hub for real-time performance analysis.
* Group your most important or production Oracle Databases together, or group together databases that reside across compartments into a Database Group, and monitor them.
* Create SQL jobs to perform administrative operations on a single Oracle Database or a Database Group.
* Use AWR Explorer to generate customizable graphical performance overviews for selected time periods.
* Generate on-demand ADDM reports for performance analysis and receive recommendations on improvements.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases.
* Monitor and administer an on-premises Oracle Database.
* Monitor and administer Oracle Cloud Databases.
* Monitor and administer Oracle Autonomous Databases.
