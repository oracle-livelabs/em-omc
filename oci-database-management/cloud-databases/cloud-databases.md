# Setting up Database Management for Oracle Cloud Databases

## Introduction

In this lab, you will go through the steps to set up Database Management for Oracle Cloud Databases.

Database Management service now also supports Oracle Cloud Databases, which are Oracle Databases on the following Co-managed Oracle Database Cloud solutions:
-	Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems
-	Exadata Cloud Service

![Architecture](./images/architecture.png " ")

Database Management features for Oracle Cloud Databases are available as part of two Management Options, which you can select when enabling Database Management.

The Full Management option includes all Database Management features for Oracle Database Enterprise Editions, including the following features. The Full Management option is also available for Oracle Database Standard Edition but doesnâ€™t include Performance Hub features.

* Monitoring and managing capabilities for your fleet of databases.
* SKU features, which include advanced Performance Hub features, such as automatic database diagnostic monitor (ADDM) and blocking sessions and other features, such as scheduled fobs, tablespace monitoring, and database parameters.
* Features available as part of Basic Management.

The Basic Management option includes the following features:

* 14 basic monitoring metrics, such as CpuUtilization, StorageAllocated, and UserCalls. These metrics are displayed in the OCI Monitoring service and on the **Database Details** page of the database after Database Management is enabled.
* Active session history (ASH) analytics and SQL monitoring features in Performance Hub for multitenant container databases (CDBs). These features are not available for pluggable databases.

Estimated Time: 50 minutes

### Objectives

Set up Database Management to monitor and manage Oracle Databases on the following Co-managed Oracle Database Cloud solutions:

-   Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems

-   Exadata Cloud Service

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Oracle Database running on Oracle Database Cloud Service - Please check documentation to [Create a DB System] ( https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/creatingDBsystem.htm#create).

## Task 1: Oracle Cloud Database-related Prerequisite Tasks

1. Set database monitoring user credentials in the Oracle Cloud Database. You must grant a database user, for example, DBSNMP, the privileges required to monitor and manage the Oracle Cloud Database.

    Connect to DBCS database as **SYSDBA** and execute the following :

    ```
    <copy>
    GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT SELECT ANY DICTIONARY, SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT ALTER SYSTEM TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT ADVISOR TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY TO dbsnmp;
    alter user dbsnmp account unlock;
    alter user dbsnmp identified by "<password>";
    </copy>
    ```

    The database user password checks in Database Management require the password to be Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant:

    * Password length must be between 14 to 127 characters.
    * Password must have at least one lowercase, one uppercase, one digit, and one special character.

## Task 6: Create a Database Management private endpoint

You must create a private endpoint to connect Database Management to an Oracle Cloud Database.

The private endpoint is a representation of Database Management in the VCN in which the Oracle Cloud Database can be accessed, and acts as a VNIC with private IP addresses in a subnet of your choice. The private endpoint need not be on the same subnet as the Oracle Cloud Database, although, it must be on a subnet that can communicate with the Oracle Cloud Database.

Refer [Create a Database Management Private Endpoint]( https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/database-management/doc/perform-database-management-prerequisite-tasks.html#GUID-AC816009-3FE9-42A1-A133-83281E0790FD) for best practices.
