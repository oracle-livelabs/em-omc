# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop there are nine lab exercises. They have been organized to help you become familiar with the setup and use of this service's key capabilities: performing common Database Management tasks using the Oracle Cloud. In this lab, we have simulated an on-premises database so you do not have to setup or use one of your own on-premises databases.

Estimated Workshop Time: 5 hours

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Management (OCI Database Management)

As a DevOps user or Database Administrator, you can use the OCI Database Management service to monitor and manage your Oracle Databases. The Database Management service supports Oracle Databases located on-premises and connected to a resource in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure External Database service (referred to as External Oracle Databases). Database Management service also supports Oracle Autonomous Databases and Oracle Cloud Databases, which are Oracle Databases on the following Co-managed Oracle Database Cloud solutions:
-	Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems
-	Exadata Cloud Service

Database Management supports Oracle Database versions 11.2.0.4 and later. Using the Database Management service you can:

* Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of all your Oracle Databases together (Fleet of databases).
* You can compare and analyze database metrics over a selected period.
* Group your most important or production Oracle Databases together, or group together databases that reside across compartments into a Database Group, and monitor them.
* Create SQL jobs to perform administrative operations on a single Oracle Database or a Database Group.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Provision a compute instance on the Oracle Cloud to simulate an on-premises Oracle Database.
* Set up the Management agent for Database Management.
* Register the on-premises Oracle Database with the External Database service and enable the Database Management service.
* Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases.
* Monitor and administer an on-premises Oracle Database(simulated).
* Monitor and administer Oracle Cloud Databases.
* Monitor and administer Oracle Autonomous Databases.
