## Introduction

In this lab, you will go through the steps to download and install the management agent to be used in the context of Database Management service.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

-   Download and install the Management Agent.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Lab: Generate SSH Key (FreeTier and Paid accounts)
* Lab: Environment Setup or Verify Setup
* Lab: Setup pluggable databases and workload
* Lab: Prerequisite: Create a dynamic group and policies for agent communication

## Task 1: Download the Agent Software

Perform the following steps to download the agent software:

1.  From the Oracle Cloud Console **Navigation menu** located in the upper left, click **Observability & Management**. Under **Management Agent**, click **Downloads and Keys**.

    ![Downloads and Keys Page](./images/agentdownloadandkeys.png " ")

2.  On the Software Download pane, select the operating system that the Management Agent will be installed on from the **Download** column with **Package type** as **RPM**.

3.  Click the link specific to your operating system to download the agent software file. For example, click **Agent for LINUX (X86_64)**.

4.  Copy the agent software file to the compute instance you created in the previous lab.

## Task 2: Create an Agent Install Key

1.  You need to create an agent install key before performing the Management Agent installation. An agent install key is issued against your tenancy and validates the authenticity of the installation.

2.  On **Download and Keys** page, scroll down to the **Install keys** section. The Install Keys pane is displayed at the bottom of the page.

    a) On the Install Keys pane, click **Create Key** to create a key

    ![Agent Install Pane](./images/install-keys.png " ")

    b) Enter the required details in the Create Key window

    -  In the **Key Name** field, specify a name (db-demo) to identify the key.
    -  In the **Compartment** field, select the compartment **dbmgmt-demo** from the drop-down list. This is the compartment where the agent resource will be created.
    -  In the **Maximum Installs** field, specify a number that indicates the maximum number of installs that can be associated with the key. Default value is 1000.
    -  In the **Valid for** field, specify a number that indicates the period the key is valid for. Default value is 1 Week.
    -  Click **Create**.

        ![Create Agent Install Key](./images/createkey.png " ")

3.  On the Agent Install Keys section, identify the row with the agent key named as **db-demo**. Click on the three dots and choose the option **Download Key to File** to save the install key to your local desktop.  

    ![Agent Install Keys](./images/agentinstallkeys.png " ")

## Task 3: Install the agent

1. Open up the terminal of your choice and log in to the compute instance you created in the previous lab.
2. Copy the following commands into your terminal.  

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo rpm -ivh oracle.mgmt_agent.rpm
    </copy>
    ```
![Install Agent RPM](./images/installagentrpm.png " ")

3. Create a response file named input.rsp using a text editor under /opt/oracle/mgmt\_agent. Copy the contents of the downloaded install key into input.rsp file. Note that you have switched to the mgmt\_agent user now. The agent installation process creates a new user called mgmt\_agent. All agent files are copied and installed by mgmt_agent user. After creating the response file, check the file permissions and ensure it has read permissions for all users.

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo -u mgmt_agent sh
    cd /opt/oracle/mgmt_agent    
    vi input.rsp
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Create input](./images/createinput.png " ")

    ![Input file](./images/inputfile.png " ")

4. Update **AgentDisplayName** and **CredentialWalletPassword** as below in input.rsp. Password of the agent wallet that the user provides is a custom password for the wallet to store sensitive information. Password minimum length is 8 characters and must contain alphabetic characters combined with numbers or special characters.

    ```
    <copy>
    AgentDisplayName = dbm_demo
    CredentialWalletPassword = password
    </copy>
    ```

5. As **opc** user, configure the management agent using the response file.

    ```
    <copy>
    sudo /opt/oracle/mgmt_agent/agent_inst/bin/setup.sh opts=/opt/oracle/mgmt_agent/input.rsp
    </copy>
    ```
![Agent Setup](./images/agentsetup.png " ")

## Task 4: Verify the Management Agent Installation

1. From the Oracle Cloud Console **Navigation menu** (aka hamburger menu) located in the upper left, click **Observability & Management** and **Management Agent**.
2. Click **Agents** from the left menu.
3. Select compartment **dbmgmt-demo** from the list of compartments on the left.
4. From the Agents list, look for the agent that was recently installed using the Created column which displays the date of the agent installation or the Host column which displays the host name where the agent was installed.
