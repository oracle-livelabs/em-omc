3. Analyze SQL with SQL Tuning Advisor. Under **Resources** section, click **SQL Tuning Advisor** to navigate to the **SQL Tuning Advisor** page.

     ![SQL Tuning Advisor](./images/odaa-dbm-sql-tuning-advisor.png "SQL Tuning Advisor")

     SQL tuning is an important aspect of database system performance tuning. SQL Tuning Advisor is a mechanism for resolving problems related to sub-optimally performing SQL statements. It takes one or more SQL statements or one SQL Tuning Set (STS) as input and invokes the Automatic Tuning Optimizer to analyze the statements. 

     SQL Tuning Advisor generates output that provides the following findings and recommendations:

     - Collection of object statistics
     - Creation of indexes
     - Rewriting SQL statements
     - Creation of SQL profiles
     - Creation of SQL plan baselines

4. Use SPM to manage SQL execution plans. Under **Resources** section, click **SQL Plan Management** to navigate to the **SQL Plan Management** page.

     ![SQL Plan Management](./images/odaa-dbm-sql-plan-management.png "SQL Plan Management")

     SPM is a preventative mechanism that enables the Oracle optimizer to automatically manage SQL plans, ensuring that the database uses only known or verified plans. The performance of any database application heavily relies on consistent SQL statement execution. A SQL statementâ€™s execution plan can change unexpectedly for a variety of reasons such as regathering optimizer statistics, changes to the optimizer parameters or schema or metadata definitions. SPM provides "plan stability" through a framework that preserves the current SQL plans amidst environment changes, yet allows changes only for better plans. When a new SQL plan is found for a SQL statement, it will not be used until it has been verified to have comparable or better performance than the current plan.

     You can perform the following SPM tasks in Database Management:

     - Manage SQL plan baselines.
     - Submit tasks to load SQL plans into SQL plan baselines.
     - Perform configuration tasks such as enabling, disabling, or editing SQL plan baseline, automatic plan capture, and Automatic SPM Evolve Advisor task parameters.
