Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

Set up Database Management to monitor and manage Oracle Database@Azure Cloud Databases.

Here are some of the important tasks you can perform using Diagnostics & Management features:
- Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases. You can also compare and analyze database metrics over a selected period of time.
- Use Performance Hub for a single-pane-of-glass view of database performance, which enables you to quickly diagnose performance issues.
- Use AWR Explorer to visualize historical performance data from AWR snapshots in easy-to-interpret charts.
- Use the other available Diagnostics & Management features to monitor, manage, and administer a single Oracle Database.
- Use dashboards to visualize, explore and analyze database performance metrics.

## Prerequisites

Understand the Oracle Database@Azure compartment structure: 
Oracle Database@Azure Exadata Infrastructure is created in the auto-generated compartment with the name matches the Azure Subscription ID.

### Add Required IAM Policies

- From the **Oracle Cloud console navigation menu** located in the upper left, click **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, click **Policies**.
- Click **Create Policy**. In the **Create Policy** dialog :
- **Name**: Enter MulticloudLink\_ODBAA\_20240227\_DBM\_Policy
- **Description**: Enter Multicloud ODBAA Database Management Service Policy
- **Compartment**: Select root.
- Enable **Show manual editor**.
- Enter the following in **Policy Builder**:
- **Policy statements**

    ```
    <copy>
    Allow service dpd to read secret-family in compartment MulticloudLink_ODBAA_20240105042431
    Allow service dpd to manage objects in compartment MulticloudLink_ODBAA_20240105042431
    Allow group odaa_dbmgmt-group to manage dbmgmt-family in tenancy 
    Allow group odaa_dbmgmt-group to read database-family in tenancy 
    Allow group odaa_dbmgmt-group to manage vnics in tenancy 
    Allow group odaa_dbmgmt-group to use subnets in tenancy 
    Allow group odaa_dbmgmt-group to use network-security-groups in tenancy

    </copy>
    ```

## Task 1: Create Database Monitor User

Set database monitoring user credentials in the **Oracle Database@Azure**. You must grant a database user, for example, **DBSNMP**, the privileges required to monitor and manage the Oracle Database@Azure Databases.

    Connect to DBCS database as **SYSDBA** and execute the following :

    ```
    <copy>
    GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT SELECT ANY DICTIONARY, SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT ALTER SYSTEM TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT ADVISOR TO dbsnmp;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY TO dbsnmp;
    alter user dbsnmp account unlock;
    alter user dbsnmp identified by "<password>";
    </copy>
    ```

The database user password checks in Database Management require the password to be Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant:

- Password length must be between 14 to 127 characters.
- Password must have at least one lowercase, one uppercase, one digit, and one special character.

## Task 2: Create OCI Vault and Secret to Store Database Monitoring User Credentials

- From the Oracle Cloud Console **Navigation Menu** located in the upper left, click Identity & Security and click Vault.
- On the **OCI Vaults** page, click **Create Vault**.
- Create in **Compartment**: Select the name of compartment.
- **Name**: Enter OnM_vault.
- Click **Create Vault**.

     ![Multicloud Vault](./images/odaa-vault1.png "Multicloud Vault")

- Click the vault **OnM_vault**
- On the Vault Details page, click **Create Key**. 
- On the **Create Key** page, select all the defaults
- Enter **Name** : **OnM_key**.

     ![Multicloud Vault Key](./images/odaa-vaultkey1.png "Multicloud Vault Key")

* On the **Vault Details** page, confirm the State of key is Enabled. 
* In the left pane, click **Secrets**.

Click Create **Secret**. On the **Create Secret** page, enter the following :

* **Compartment**: Select Compartment Name
* **Name**: <dbname\>_secret
* **Description**: Monitoring user password
* **Encryption Key**: Select OnM_key
* **Select Manual secret generation**
* **Secret Contents**: Enter the DBSNMP user password
* Click **Create Secret**.

    Confirm the Status of <dbname\>_secret is Active.

## Task 3: Create a Database Management Private Endpoint

- **Database Management Private Endpoint** is required to enable communication between Database Management and your Oracle Database@Azure in a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). 
- Private endpoints are needed to connect to Oracle Database@Azure running in a private VCN.
- **Database Management Private Endpoint** is its network point of presence in the Oracle Database@Azureâ€™s VCN. 
- The private endpoint need not be on the same subnet as the Oracle Database@Azure, although, it must be on a subnet that can communicate with the Oracle Database@Azure.
- Private End point must be on a subnet in the customer VCN that can communicate with the Oracle Cloud Database

Refer Create a Database Management Private Endpoint for best practices.

- Go to **Navigation menu**, click **Observability & Management**. Under **Database Management**, click **Administration**.
- On the left pane on the **Administration** page, click **Private Endpoint** and select the compartment in which you want to create the private endpoint.
- On the **Private Endpoints** page, click **Create Private Endpoint**.
- In the **Create Private Endpoint** dialog:
- **Name**: Enter DBM_PE.
- **Description**: Enter Database Management Private Endpoint.
- **Choose Compartment**: Select the compartment in which you want the private endpoint to reside.
- **Use this private endpoint for RAC databases**: Select this check box if you want to create a Database Management private endpoint for Oracle Database@Azures RAC databases.
- **Virtual Cloud Network**: Select the VCN in which the Oracle Database@Azure can be accessed.
- **Subnet**: Select a subnet within the selected VCN.
- **Network Security Group**: Optionally, select an NSG
- Click **Create Private Endpoint**.

## Task 4: (Optional) Add Security Rules to enable communications

- Add ingress and egress security rules to Security Lists or Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- You must have the required permissions to add the ingress and egress rules to Security Lists or Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- For databases running on RAC and Exadata Cloud Service, use SCAN IP for communicating with Database Management service
    
     ![Multicloud Security List Egress Configuration](./images/odaa-securitylistEgressConfig.png "Multicloud Security List Egress Configuration")

- Add stateful security rules to a Security List to enable communication between a Database Management private endpoint and Oracle Database@Azure in the same subnet in the VCN.
- Ingress rule for the Oracle Database@Azure's VCN: The Oracle Database@Azure's VCN (on port 1521) can receive incoming traffic from the Database Management private IP address from any port.
    
     ![Multicloud Security List Ingress](./images/odaa-securitylistIngress.png "Multicloud Security List Ingress")

- Egress rule for the Database Management private endpoint: The Database Management private IP address (from any port) can send requests to the Oracle Database@Azure's VCN on port 1521.
