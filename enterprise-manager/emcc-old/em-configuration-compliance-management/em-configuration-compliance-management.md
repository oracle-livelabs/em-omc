### About Configuration and Compliance Management

Changes to configuration properties of database and host targets invariably happen, typically because of common events like patches and upgrades. At some point a change to one component can affect the overall system in a negative way. Detecting the root cause becomes paramount. With Configuration Management, one can continuously monitor and track configuration drifts of targets against the reference configuration. Enterprise Manger automatically collects a comprehensive set of configuration properties of all managed targets across the datacenter and cloud.

With Compliance Management, one can run automated, continuous security checks based on industry standards and best practices, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Reinforce industry standards such as STIG and CIS with custom policies to protect against threats, providing a secure databases and hosts for applications. These security checks provide a compliance score to depict the overall compliance of targets against an industry standard benchmark.

### Prerequisites
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Initialize Environment

*Note*: This lab environment is setup with Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Release 13.5 and Database 19.10 as Oracle Management Repository.

## Task 1: Inventory & Usage Details

### Overview

The IT Manager wants to get an inventory of all existing databases managed by Enterprise Manager including different versions of databases, number of instances deployed over a period of time. This is to reduce number of different configuration sets and increase standardization across the data center.

All the items in this step are read-only, primary goal is to learn about inventory usage details within Enterprise Manager for all supported targets

### Execution
1. On the browser window on the right preloaded with *Enterprise Manager*, if not already logged in, click on the *Username* field and login with the credentials provided below.

    ```
    Username: <copy>sysman</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Password: <copy>welcome1</copy>
    ```

    ![](../initialize-environment/images/em-login.png " ")

2.  From the Enterprise menu, select Configuration, then select Inventory and  Usage Details

  ![](images/ecm1_inventory_usage_menu_item.png " ")

3.  In the ‘Show’ filter menu, select **Databases** to see all database instances managed by Enterprise Manager

  ![](images/ecm1_inventory_usage_details1.png " ")

4.  Analyze various database versions and number of instances for each version

5.  Explore pie chart to see the break-down of database inventory by color-code percentages. Also, in the **Graphical View**, choose **Trend** radio button to see the growth of given database instance over a period of time.

  ![](images/ecm1_inventory_usage_details2.png " ")

6.  In the Details table below, you will see details like

    - Database instance name
    - Host on which this database is located
    - Database type - cluster or single instance
    - Database version number
    - OS specific details like OS version, platform, etc.
    - Most importantly, LOB/Department information
      Details table gives more information of each Database instance for you to get a good understanding of number of database targets deployed on a given host with OS version. If your organization uses properties like Lifecycle, Line of Business or Department, then you will be able to determine the number of targets deployed for a given business unit.Explore these features to get a good handle on Inventory and Usage details.

7. Export inventory details to excel for reports. These inventory details can be exported to an excel file for offline analysis or sharing the report to management. With the excel report, you can filter based on the properties you are using to show department or line of business specific assets allocation and usage.

  ![](images/ecm1_inventory_usage_details_report.png " ")

## Task 3: One Time Database Comparison

### Overview

In this step, you will compare two database targets to determine configuration differences. One of the databases will act as reference target that aligns with your configuration policy. Your objective is to compare initialization parameters to ensure it is compliant with reference target

### Execution

1.  Log into your Enterprise Manager as **sysman** as indicated in the Prerequisites step if not already done.

2.  From the Enterprise menu, select **Configuration**, then select **Configuration & Drift Management**

  ![](images/ecm2_one_time_database_comparison_menu.png " ")

12. Click **Submit**. Comparison of the selected targets happens and below are the results.

  ![](images/ecm2_one_time_database_comparison_results1.png " ")

13. Filter configurations items to review only Initialization Parameters.

  ![](images/ecm2_one_time_database_comparison_results2.png " ")

  You can see the differences in the Initialization Parameters between the two targets.

  Under the target compared column, you will see few icons. The icons that appear in the view are mostly intuitive:
      - Equal sign means parameter properties are same across the reference and target compared
      - Not equal sign indicates parameter properties are different across the reference and target compared
      - A red box with 1 (left only) means that the comparison did not find a matching item to compare, this means 2nd target doesn’t have property configured to compare
      - A red box 2 (right only) means that the comparison did not find a matching item to compare to the second configuration


14. Now, let us go to Comparison and Drift Management dashboard page for further analysis of results

  ![](images/ecm2_one_time_database_comparison_dashboard1.png " ")

15. In the dashboard page, donut chart for Comparison Overview dashlet gives you the summary result. Click on the **donut chart** to analyze one-time comparison result details.

  ![](images/ecm2_one_time_database_comparison_dashboard2.png " ")

15. Click on **One-Time Comparison Results** tab to review all corresponding comparison definitions

## Task 5: Database Security Compliance

### Overview

Compliance Management provides the ability to evaluate the compliance of targets and systems as they relate to business best practices for configuration, security, and storage.

<!-- In this lab, you will setup a compliance standard for monitoring security compliance of Oracle Database target and analyze the compliance score and violations -->

Terminology Used in this Compliance specific workshop

### Compliance Standard

A compliance standard is a collection of checks or rules that follow broadly accepted best practices. It is the Cloud Control representation of a compliance control that must be tested against some set of IT infrastructure to determine if the control is being followed. This ensures that IT infrastructure, applications, business services and processes are organized, configured, managed, and monitored properly. A compliance standard evaluation can provide information related to platform compatibility, known issues affecting other customers with similar configurations, security vulnerabilities, patch recommendations, and more. A compliance standard is also used to define where to perform real-time change monitoring.

A compliance standard is mapped to one or more compliance standard rules and is associated to one or more targets which should be evaluated.

### Compliance Standard Rule

A compliance standard rule is a specific test to determine if a configuration data change affects compliance. A compliance standard rule is mapped to one or more compliance standards

### Execution
