Oracle Database can manage the SGA memory and instance PGA memory. You designate only the total memory size to be used by the instance, and the database dynamically exchanges memory between the SGA and the instance PGA as needed to meet processing demands. This capability is referred to as *Automatic Memory Management*. In this memory management mode, the database also dynamically tunes the sizes of the individual SGA components and the sizes of the individual PGAs.

Upon installation, you can let Oracle Database manage the memory automatically, or select to manually configure the instance memory structures. For both manual and automatic memory management, Oracle Database sends alerts which identify memory sizing problems that require your attention.

The simplest way to manage instance memory is to allow the database instance to automatically manage and tune it for you. You set a target memory size initialization parameter (`MEMORY_TARGET`) and optionally a maximum memory size initialization parameter (`MEMORY_MAX_TARGET`). The total memory that the instance uses remains relatively constant, based on the value of `MEMORY_TARGET`, and the instance automatically distributes memory between the system global area (SGA) and the instance program global area (instance PGA). As memory requirements change, the instance dynamically redistributes memory between the SGA and instance PGA.

If you do not enable Automatic Memory Management for your Oracle Database, then you must manually set the memory for both SGA and PGA. While installing Oracle Database, the installer gives you an option to enable Automatic Memory Management. If you did not enable Automatic Memory Management during database installation, you can enable it as explained in this workshop.
