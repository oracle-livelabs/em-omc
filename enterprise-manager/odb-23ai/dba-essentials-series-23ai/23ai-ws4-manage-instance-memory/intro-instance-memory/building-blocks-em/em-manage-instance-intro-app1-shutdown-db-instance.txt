The process of shutting down the instance is the reverse of starting it. It includes the following stages.

1.  Shut down the database using [](var:prod_em) or SQL Plus command. Data files and log files are closed. Users can no longer access the database after it is shut down.

1.  The Oracle instance dismounts the database and updates relevant entries in the control file to record a clean shutdown. The control file is closed. The database is now closed and only the instance remains.

1.  The Oracle instance stops the background processes of the instance and deallocates the shared memory used by the SGA.

You can shut down an instance in the following modes.

-   `NORMAL` — The default shutdown mode. It takes long time to shut down.
-   `IMMEDIATE` — Shuts down the database quickly.
-   `TRANSACTIONAL` — Completes the active transaction and then shuts down the database.
-   `ABORT` — Shuts down the database instantaneously without waiting for the transactions to complete.

	> **Note**: Use it in emergency situations only because it can cause loss of data.

-   `TIMEOUT` — Waits for active users to disconnect or for the transactions to complete within a limited waiting period. If all events blocking the shutdown do not occur within one hour, the database cancels the `SHUTDOWN` operation.
