A host can have multiple Oracle Databases, each with its own set of data files. A database instance has a unique ID known as an *Oracle System ID (`ORACLE_SID`)*. An `ORACLE_SID` helps you identify the instance to which you want to connect. To connect with a database instance on your host, you identify the instance by setting the environment variables `ORACLE_SID` and `ORACLE_HOME`.
