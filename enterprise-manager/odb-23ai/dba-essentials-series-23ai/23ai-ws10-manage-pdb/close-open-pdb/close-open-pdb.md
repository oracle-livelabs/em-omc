# Close and open PDBs

## Introduction

This lab shows how to administer the Pluggable Databases (PDBs) in a multitenant Container Database (CDB) from Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (EM). You can close one or more PDBs in the database simultaneously. Similarly, you can open one PDB or all PDBs together in your database.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

Perform these tasks on the PDBs from Oracle Enterprise Manager:
 -   Close PDBs
 -   Open PDBs

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have -

 -   An Oracle Cloud account
 -   Completed all previous labs successfully
 -   Logged in to Oracle Enterprise Manager in a web browser as *sysman*

> **Note:** This lab contains system-specific values and paths. These details might vary depending on the system you are using.

## Task 1: Close PDBs in CDB

Closing a PDB may disrupt any ongoing operations on that PDB. You can close one PDB or close all PDBs together in your database in a single step. To close all PDBs in the CDB, at least one PDB must be open.

In this task, you will close the PDBs, namely *ORCL1PDB* and *PDB3*, in the CDB. Before closing a PDB, check its current status.

You can open the Databases page from the menu **Targets** &gt; **Databases**.

1.  On the Database pages, click the database instance name, for example *orcl1.us.oracle.com*, to open the instance home page.

	 ![Databases home page](./../intro-pdb-mgmt-db/images/manage-pdb-17-view-pdbs-db-list-05.png " ")

    The green upward arrows in the **Status** field indicate that the database instance and the PDBs are up and running.

	[](include:n-db-page)

1.  From the **Oracle Database** menu on the instance home page, select **Control** &gt; **Open/Close Pluggable Database**.

	 ![Control menu - Open/Close PDB](./images/manage-pdb-01-control-menu.png " ")

	 [](include:db-login)

	 ![Database Login](./images/manage-pdb-02-dblogin-orcl1.png " ")

1.  Oracle Enterprise Manager opens the Open and Close PDB page. Verify that it displays all the PDBs in your container.   
	You can also search for a PDB by its name or use the **State** filter to view PDBs that are *Opened* or *Closed*.

	 ![Control menu - Open/Close PDBs](./images/manage-pdb-03-open-close.png " ")

    The table displays the following information for each target PDB:

     -   **Target** - discovered database systems
     -   **Name** - PDB name
     -   **State** - whether the PDB is *Open* (an icon with a pencil) or *Close* (a lock)
     -   **Result** - whether a task succeeded or not

1.  The **State** column displays an icon with a pencil. Mouse over the icon and verify that the PDBs are *Open*.

	 ![PDB state open](./images/manage-pdb-04-pdb-open.png " ")

     > **Note:** With the **Open Read Only** option, users can run queries on a PDB to view information but cannot perform transactions in the database, such as create, insert, update, or delete operations. For this lab, do not use this option.

1.  Select the PDB, *ORCL1PDB*, and click **Close** to start the close operation.

	 ![Close ORCLPDB](./images/manage-pdb-05-close-orcl1pdb.png " ")

     > **Note:** The Open and Close PDB page supports multiselect. Use the **Shift** or **Ctrl** button to select more than one PDB. You can also click the PDB table and press **Ctrl** + **A** to select all PDBs.

1.  Oracle Enterprise Manager displays a window to confirm this activity. Click **Yes** to close the PDB.

	 ![Confirm closing ORCLPDB](./images/manage-pdb-06-confirm-closure-orcl1pdb.png " ")

    Oracle Enterprise Manager processes the operation and closes the PDB instantly. The icon in the **State** column for *ORCL1PDB* changes to a lock and the **Result** column displays a check mark.

	 ![ORCLPDB closed](./images/manage-pdb-07-orcl1pdb-closed.png " ")

    You have closed the PDB *ORCL1PDB* but the other PDB, *PDB3*, is still open.

     > **Note:** If you try closing a PDB which is already in *Close* state, then the **Result** column displays an icon indicating that EM did not perform the task.

1.  Now close the other PDB. Select *PDB3* and click **Close**.

	 ![Close PDB3](./images/manage-pdb-08-close-pdb3.png " ")

	On the confirmation window, click **Yes** to close the PDB.

	 ![Confirm closing PDB3](./images/manage-pdb-09-confirm-closure-pdb3.png " ")

    Oracle Enterprise Manager closes this PDB also. The **State** column for *PDB3* displays a lock icon and the **Result** column displays a check mark indicating that the task *Succeeded*. Mouse over the icons in the **State** column to verify that the PDBs are in *Close* state.

	 ![PDB3 closed](./images/manage-pdb-10-pdb3-closed.png " ")

You have closed the PDBs, *ORCL1PDB* and *PDB3*, in the CDB. Thus, you can close one or more PDBs in your database. Now, try opening these PDBs again from Oracle Enterprise Manager.

## Task 2: Open PDBs

In this task, you will open the PDBs, namely *ORCL1PDB* and *PDB3*, in the CDB. Before opening a PDB, check its current status.

1.  From the **Targets** menu, select **Databases** to open the Databases page.

	 ![Target menu - Databases](./images/manage-pdb-11-targets-menu.png " ")

1.  Click the expand/collapse triangle next to the instance name, *orcl1.us.oracle.com*, to view the current status of PDBs.

	 ![Databases home - PDBs down](./images/manage-pdb-12-db-list-pdb-down.png " ")

     > **Note:** If you have additional PDBs in your database, then you might have green upward arrows in the **Status** column. However, for *ORCLPDB* and *PDB3*, **Status** shows red downward arrows indicating that the PDBs are currently *close*.

    Now proceed with opening the PDBs. Click the database instance name, *orcl1.us.oracle.com*, to open the instance home page.

1.  From the **Oracle Database** menu, select **Control** &gt; **Open/Close Pluggable Database**.

	 ![Control menu - Open/Close PDBs](./images/manage-pdb-13-control-menu-down.png " ")

	[](include:n-db-login-opt)

	 Oracle Enterprise Manager opens the Open and Close PDB page.

1.  Press the **Ctrl** button on your keyboard, select both PDBs, *ORCL1PDB* and *PDB3*, and click **Open**.

	 ![Open PDBs](./images/manage-pdb-14-open-pdbs.png " ")

    Oracle Enterprise Manager processes the operation and opens the PDBs in read/write mode. The **State** column displays icon with pencil and the **Result** column displays check marks for both PDBs.

1.  Mouse over the icon in the **Result** column to verify that the task *Succeeded*.

	 ![PDBs opened](./images/manage-pdb-15-pdbs-opened-succeeded.png " ")

     > **Note:** If you try opening a PDB which is already in *Open* state, then the **Result** column displays an icon indicating that EM did not perform the task.

1.  From the **Targets** menu, select **Databases** to open the Databases page.

	 ![Target menu - Databases](./images/manage-pdb-11-targets-menu.png " ")

1. 	Click the expand/collapse triangle next to the instance name, *orcl1.us.oracle.com*, to view the current status of PDBs.

	 ![Databases home page](./../intro-pdb-mgmt-db/images/manage-pdb-17-view-pdbs-db-list-05.png " ")

    The green upward arrows in the **Status** field indicate that the PDBs are up and running.

You have opened the PDBs, *ORCLPDB* and *PDB3*. Thus, you can open one or more PDBs in your database.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed this workshop on *PDB management and administration in Oracle Database*.

In this workshop, you learned how to manage PDBs, such as different ways of creating new PDBs in the CDB. You deleted a PDB and unplugged a PDB from the root container and then plugged the unplugged PDB into another container. You also performed PDB administration from Oracle Enterprise Manager, such as closing and opening PDBs in your Oracle Database and checking their status.
