### About Multitenant Database Lifecycle Management
Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Lifecycle Management Pack comes with out-of-box Deployment Procedures to provision, clone, and patch  various configurations of the Oracle Database. The Management Pack offers new capabilities that simplify support for the entire lifecycle of pluggable databases, including migration, plugging and unplugging. The Management Pack features include pluggable database (PDB) provisioning and management from the self-service portal, PDB patching and upgrades, and PDB relocation to new platforms.

### Objectives

The objective of this workshop is to highlight Oracle Enterprise Manager 13c Lifecycle Management capabilities for multitenant databases.

 Now that you have gone through PDB life cycle operations, we will switch focus and cover the use case of building a private cloud using Enterprise Manager and how to quickly provision (with minimal inputs) and manage PDBs using PDB-as-a-service (PDBaaS).

## Task 5: Self-Service to Request PDB Using PDBaaS

With the Self-Service Portal, cloud users can request an  Pluggable Database through a simple process, monitor resource consumptions, and manage the pluggable database through an intuitive graphical user interface. Expiry time is provided while requesting the PDB instance and PDB is automatically deleted based on the expiry time.

1. Login into Enterprise Manager as a Self-Service User. Self-Service User credentials are: **cyrus/welcome1**
2. By default, you will see the Database Cloud Self Service Portal landing page as shown below.

  ![](images/2d9dd5550b4774b590ccb4b1815ac70d.jpg " ")

3. Click the **Create Instance** button and then Click on Select icon for **Provision New Empty Pluggable Database**.

  ![](images/ee694403e4c718e224a01ae91dbc88fd.jpg " ")

  Note: There are two service templates pertaining to Pluggable Database

    -  **Provision New Empty Pluggable Database**: This template enables users to create a new pluggable database in a container database configured by DBA.
    -  **Provision Pluggable Database with Data**: This template enables users to create a new pluggable database with data from non-container database.

4. In the **Pluggable Database Configuration** section, enter Service and SID details:

      * Name: **YOUR INITIALS\_PDB2** (e.g. AS\_PDB2)
      * Database Service Name **: SERVICE\_YOUR INITIALS\_PDB2 (e.g. SERVICE\_AS\_PDB2)**
      * Workload Size: Choose **Small**

    ![](images/fd8fe73465009dbd65e2231503481e40.jpg " ")

5. Enter the Credentials details in the “**Pluggable Database Administrator Account**” and for Tablespaces, select **Accept default**

    ```
    Administrator Name: <copy>PDBADMIN</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Password: <copy>welcome1</copy>
    ```


    ![](images/181bed80a9978ed3e02c050838749f2b.jpg " ")

6. Instance Details, keep all defaults as they are. The Properties Page has the properties for the instance. The Self-Service Administrator has configured this as a optional step. However, properties can help users locate an instance more quickly. So Enter:

    ```
    Contact: <copy>CYRUS</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Lifecycle Status: <copy>Test</copy>
    ```

    ![](images/f5f29e12efaaf8a1fce318e871d9009d.jpg " ")

7. Instance Duration - For Instance Duration Start: Accept the default (Immediately). For Duration: Specify 4 hours from the current time by selecting the “Until” radio button, changing to current date and specify time to be 4 hours from the current time

    ![](images/3035739cd46353882939fd894197f2ed.jpg " ")

8. Click on Submit button

  What do these options represent? In most cases the PDBaaS options are self-explanatory. The self-service user should be able to provision a PDB by entering minimal information. Fields with an ‘\*’ represent mandatory input fields. Please refer to the table listed below for a description of each option:

  | **Field**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Request Name                | By default, it is the Self-Service User Requestor name with timestamp. This field can be modified                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Zone                        | The Zone is a PaaS Zone that represents hosts/vm, where the PDB database will be deployed for this request. The zones are configured by the administrator. Self-service user need not know the host or platform details.                                                                           |
| PDB Name                    | Required input. PDB database with user defined will be created for the container database                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Database Service Name       | The user defined prefix for the database service or alias for this self-service PDB. The rest of the service name will be system generated and will be associated with a database resource management plan.                                                                                        |
| Workload Size               | The resources allocated to the Database Service. The database resource management plan is derived from this option. You can configure multiple workload sizes. Each service template will contain unique workload sizes. This typically depends on the roles assigned to self-service user.        |
| Schedule Request            | Self-service user has the ability to create a PDB database immediately or choose to create at a later time. In this lab exercise, the administrator has defined a policy, so a self- service user has to specify time duration. The PDB database will be automatically deleted after the duration. |
| Administrator Name/Password | A database user with required administrative privileges will be created on the provisioned PDB. A self-service user will be able to administer the PDB database by logging in as this database user.                                                                                               |

9.  Once you submit a request, you will be redirected back to the “**Database Cloud Services**” Page. Your PDB creation request has been submitted to Enterprise Manager for execution. Under “**Requests**” region, you should see 2 requests: “**Create**” and “**Delete**” request

  ![](images/0d01a3a45ebb7f97fcc8752d52241b9d.jpg " ")

10. At this point, provisioning engine has received a request to create a PDB based on the service template and input provided by self-service user. You will also notice the delete operation is scheduled for future (not started yet) time. Click on the **hourglass** icon under Status column for the Create Pluggable Database step. You will see details of request.

11.  It will perform the following actions:

     * Create database roles and PDB
     * Create a resource plan based on the workload size
     * Create and register the database

  The request should take less than 10 minutes to complete. Click on refresh icon or as an alternative set Refresh to 30 seconds. The success status
indicates that PDB database was successfully created. The new PDB database should be visible under Database Cloud Services page.
