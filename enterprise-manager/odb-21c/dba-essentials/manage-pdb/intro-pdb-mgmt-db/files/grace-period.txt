Optionally, you can schedule the procedure to start at a later date and time with a grace period.Â   
The grace period is the time that defines the maximum permissible delay when attempting to run a scheduled procedure. If the procedure does not start within the grace period, then the procedure skips running.   
For this lab, do not use this option and do not select the grace period.
