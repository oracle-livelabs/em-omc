    - **Use Common Location for PDB Datafiles** - The page displays this option selected.  
    With this option, you can enter a custom location for the data files. Note that, for this lab, the target CDB does not support Oracle Managed Files (OMF).  

    - **Storage Type** - *File System*  
    Do not select Automatic Storage Management because Oracle ASM is not applicable for this workshop.   

    - **Location** - Leave the default location to store the data files.  

    - **Temporary Working Directory** - You can specify a location where to store the temporary files generated during the PDB creation process. For this lab, leave the default location, */tmp*.

    - **Post-Creation Scripts** - Oracle Database gives an option to run a custom SQL script after creating the PDB. For this lab, do not select this option.
