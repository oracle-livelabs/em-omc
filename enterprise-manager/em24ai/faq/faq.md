9. How to Reset user *oracle* password or if Named Credentials for user oracle is not working

    Reset the password for user *oracle*. As user *opc* from an external SSH terminal session (not the remote desktop), run the following

    ````
    <copy>sudo su password oracle</copy>
    ````

    If *oracle* OS user password is updated, the Named Credential for *ORACLE* and also *ORACLE_HOST* needs to be updated. This can be done on the command line as user *oracle*. Run *sudo su - oracle* first if you're not already connected as *oracle*, then run:

    ````
    <copy>
    emcli login -username=sysman -password=\<sysman_password\>
    emcli modify_named_credential -cred_name=oracle -attributes="HostPassword:\<oracle_password\>"
    emcli modify_named_credential -cred_name=oracle_host -attributes="HostPassword:\<oracle_password\>"
    emcli logout
    </copy>
    ````
    The Named Credential can also be updated via Enterprise Manager UI. On the EM Console navigate to Setup, then Security, and then Named Credentials.
