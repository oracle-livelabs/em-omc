### Prerequisites
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Initialize Environment

*Note*: This lab environment is setup with Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Release 13.5 and Database 19.10 as Oracle Management Repository. Workshop activities included in this lab will be executed both locally on the instance using Enterprise Manager Command Line Interface (EMCLI) or Rest APIs, and the Enterprise Manager console (browser)

## Task 1: Assess patch recommendation and create gold image

In this task, you will review patch recommendations for existing gold images and create a new version based on those recommendations.


1. Login to Enterprise Manager as user - emadmin. Copy and paste or type in the following username and password credentials into the fields.


    ```
    Username: <copy>emadmin</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Password: <copy>welcome1</copy>
    ```

   ![](images/em-login.png "em-login")

2. Once logged in, navigate to ***Targets >> Databases***  

    ![](images/em-navig1.png "em-navig1")

    and then ***Administration >> Fleet Maintenance Hub***

   ![](images/em-navig2.png "em-navig2")

3. Fleet Maintenance Hub is your one-stop solution for end-to-end patch assessment and operations.

    ![](images/em-hub.png "em-hub")

    In the top right corner, you see the status of ***Last Patch Recommendation Update***. If a date is shown below it, then the patch recommendation was executed on that date.

<!--
To setup patch recommendation, review [Oracle Enterprise Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en/enterprise-manager/cloud-control/enterprise-manager-cloud-control/13.5/emlcm/downloading-patch-recommendations-and-patches.html).
-->


<!--
   To successfully complete this lab, do not upload any new patch catalogs or enter your MOS credentials as described in the above documentation. Doing so will generate new recommendations that may differ from those in the upcoming sections.
-->


4. Click on Tile 2 in labeled as Patch Recommendations for Images.

    The donut chart in this tile indicates the health of your gold images. Green indicates, the number of gold images have all the recommended patches, and these images can be used for upgrade or update operations.

    Red indicates, the number of gold images are missing critical recommended patches and must refreshed before using it for upgrade or update operations. You should reach out your Administrator to refresh the image with all recommended patches.

    ![](images/tile2.png "hub-tile2")

    As an example, ***19cDB-Linux-x64-ERP*** gold image has two patch recommendations. This indicates ***19cDB-Linux-x64-ERP*** image must be refreshed to a new version that includes two recommended patches.

    Similarly, ***19cDB-Linux-x64-APPS*** has a green checkmark. This indicates ***19cDB-Linux-x64-APPS*** image is up to date and can be used for patch operations

    For this lab, we will use the ***19cDB-Linux-x64-APPS*** image to perform pdb patching.

<!--
Follow the [Link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/enterprise-manager/cloud-control/enterprise-manager-cloud-control/13.5/emlcm/image-maintenance-ui.html) to understand the steps involved in refreshing a gold image.
-->

5. In the next few steps, we will use the Fleet Maintenance Hub to refresh gold image ***19cDB-Linux-x64-ERP***.

    While the image refresh process is running, to complete the lab within the given timeline, we will use ***19cDB-Linux-x64-APPS*** to secure one of the databases.

6. Let's refresh the gold image - ***19cDB-Linux-x64-ERP***

    As observed in step 4, ***19cDB-Linux-x64-ERP*** has two patch recommendations.

    ![](images/patch-recommendation.png "patch-recommendation")

    Click on the numeric value 2.

    A new slideout will appear.

    ![](images/patch-slideout.png "slideout")

7. The next step is to create a new version in 19cDB-Linux-x64-ERP that will include the recommended patches.

    Close the slideout.

    ![](images/create-version.png "create version")

    Click on the ***"Create New Version"*** link under the Patch Recommendation column.

    Alternatively, click on the menu under Actions and create a new version.

8. In the new window, we need to provide source details, which act as input for version creation and version details.

    In the left-hand section, we first select the Oracle Home, which will be used as the source Oracle Home.

    ![](images/version-options.png "options")

    - Select Oracle Home.
      1. Click on the ***Select Oracle Home*** button. In the new screen select the Oracle Home ending with ***3383***.
      2. Select Include Patches.
      3. Select one of the radio buttons. You can either choose to clone the above selected Oracle Home, apply recommended patches to the cloned Oracle Home, and then use this home to create a new version. Alternatively, you can select the option to patch the Oracle Home and use it to create a new version.
      We will select the latter option - ***Patch the selected Oracle Home***, as shown in the image.

    - Under Work Directory, provide location where logs will be created. You may enter location as ***/tmp/u01***
    - Credentials - Provide Normal and Privileged Credentials to complete this operation.

        For Normal Host credentials, from the drop down select ***ORACLE***.
        For Privileged Host credentials, from the drop down select ***ROOT***.

    In the right hand section, provide
    - New version name that we are creating. You may enter ***v19.23DBRU***
    - Select Storage options. This will determine the source and location where the new version will be saved. We will select the default values as shown in the image.


    Click ***Next***.

9. In this screen, select the two patches that we have already downloaded and uploaded in the software library.

    ![](images/rec-patches.png "rec-patches")

As part of this update, you need to choose a CDB at 19.23 version level. For this lab, we will use ***hr.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com***. After update is completed, Finance PDB will reside in this new CDB at 19.23 version level.

    ![](images/pre-update.png "pre-update")

    Lets complete below steps to perform the pdb patching.

2. Subscribe sales CDB to goldimage ***19cDB-Linux-x64-APPS***.

    Navigate to Fleet Maintenance Hub, by clicking on ***Administration >> Fleet Maintenance Hub***

    ![](images/em-navig2.png "em-navig2")

    To patch a database, you must subscribe the target database to a gold image. You can subscribe a database to one image only, but an image can have multiple databases subscribed to it.

    In the Fleet Maintenance Hub, under the "Target Subscription" tab in Tile 1, follow these steps:

    - Click on the ***Subscribe*** button.
    - Select filter ***19*** under Release.
    - From the dropdown, select the goldimage - ***19cDB-Linux-x64-APPS***.
    - From the list of databases, select ***sales.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com***.

    Under Target Compliance columns, we see that the CDB is drifted and needs to be patched. In this lab, we will perform a PDB level patching.

    Click on the menu under Actions for the sales CDB, and select ***Update Pluggable Database***. This will launch the operator UI of Fleet Maintenance.

4. We are now at the Operator UI screen, with pre-selected values for Gold Image, Target Type and Operation.

    ![](images/patching-ui1.png "patching-ui1")

    Select Finance pdb and click ***Next***.

5. In this page, we will select relevant options and enter values wherever required.

    - Under Maintenance Task, select ***Attach Existing CDB***.
    - Under Attach Existing CDB, review the source CDB, which is ***sales.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com*** (19.17).
    - Under Destination CDB, select ***hr.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com*** (19.23).
    - Under credentials, select values from the drop-down menu as per the image.
        - Normal Host Credentials as ***ORACLE***
        - Privileged Host Credentials as ***ROOT***
        - SYSDBA Database Credentials as ***SYS_SALES***
    - Under Work Directory, enter ***/u01/tmp***
    - Under Options section, select ***Yes*** for Skip Cluster Verification Utility Checks.

    ![](images/patching-ui2.png "patching-ui2")

    Click ***Next***.

6. Click on ***Validate*** and then select ***Quick Validation***.

    ![](images/patching-ui3.png "patching-ui3")

    Once you receive the successful validation message, click ***Close*** and then hit ***Submit***.

    This unique name will allow you to track the operation. We have provided the name "Demo_update".

    ![](images/patching-ui4.png "patching-ui4")

    Copy and paste or type in the following into the Submission Procedure Name prefix.

        ```
        <copy>Demo_update</copy>
        ```

8. There are two Deployment Procedure submitted.
    - Attach Existing CDB
    - Update PDB

    Click on ***Monitor Progress***, which will open a new window.

    ![](images/patching-ui5.png "patching-ui5")

9. In the new page, under search, enter ***Demo*** so that you only see the two Deployment procedures associated with this lab.

    ![](images/patching-ui6.png "patching-ui6")

    We see that the Deployment procedure with the name "Attach" has completed successfully.

    Let's click on the Deployment procedure with the name "Update" and review the steps performed.

    ![](images/patching-ui7.png "patching-ui7")

9. With both Deployment procedures completed successfully, let's go back to the databases homepage by navigating to ***Targets -> Databases***.
    ![](images/patching-ui8.png "patching-ui8")

    We see that the Finance PDB has moved out of the sales CDB and is now plugged into the HR CDB, running at version 19.23


## Task 3: Securing Databases with Industry Standards and Best Practices

Now that you have applied security patches to your pluggable database, you want to ensure the configuration, access and user privileges are secure and audit for compliance with CIS Benchmarks which is the industry standard.

Enterprise Manager provides solution to secure and ensure compliance with security policies defined by your security office and auditors. With this solution, you can secure the entire stack from databases, underlying Linux hosts and Exadata infrastructure with out-of-box security controls.
