# Migrate and upgrade 12c database to 19c ADB

## Introduction

You can use Database Migration Workbench to migrate databases to multi-tenant architecture on Exadata on-premises, to Base Database Service (BM or VM) or Exadata Database Service (ExaCC, ExaCS), and autonomous, using TTS and data pump migration methods in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This lab demonstrate using Migration Workbench for **on-premises** to **autonomous** migration.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will perform the tasks below. Task 1 is to review the prerequisites completed in advance for this lab. In task 2 you will review the autonomous database creation completed in advance for this lab. In task 3 you will perform the pre-requisites for the autonomous database before migration. In task 4 you will create a migration activity, add details, and learn about the various configuration options. After the migration is complete, you will analyze the migration activity and compare performance before and after the migration.

### Prerequisites

- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
  - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
  - Lab: Environment Setup
  - Lab: Initialize Environment

>**Note:** This lab environment is setup with Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Release 13.5 RU7, and database 19.12 as Oracle Management Repository.

## Task 1: Launch Enterprise Manager console and review prerequisites completed in advance

Once your workshop is provisioned, click on "View Login Info" on the top right of the browser page. This opens the "Reservation Information" screen:

![Launch EM](images/launch-reservation.png " ")

For this workshop you will not use the remote desktop, so do not click the "Launch Remote Desktop" button, but rather copy the IP address of your instance. Open a new browser tab and enter the Enterprise Manager console URL for your instance as follows:

<https://*The-IP-address-you-just-copied*:7803/em>

![Security warning](../../initialize-environment/images/login-em-external-1.png " ")

> **Note:** You may see an error on the browser while accessing the Web Console - “Your connection is not private” as shown below. Ignore and add the exception to proceed.

click on the *Username* field and login with the credentials provided below.

```text
Username: <copy>sysman</copy>
```

```text
Password: <copy>welcome1</copy>
```

![EM Login](../../initialize-environment/images/login-em-external-2.png " ")

Once logged in you will be in the "Enterprise Summary" page:

![Enterprise Summary](images/enterprise-summary.png " ")

In the interest of simplifying the setup and to save time, the following requirements for the source database were completed in advance for this lab. Please review accordingly for reference.

- Source database target discovered in Enterprise Manager
    - In Enterprise Manager console, click on "Targets"->"Databases"
      ![Databases](images/databases.png " ")
    - orcl is our source database
- Data Pump user requirement
    - For the source database (orcl), an export user (EXP_USER) was created with password "welcome1" and the required privileges
    - To learn more about the the required privileges review "[Database Migration Prerequisites](https://docs.oracle.com/en/enterprise-manager/cloud-control/enterprise-manager-cloud-control/13.5/emmwb/database-migration-workbench.html#GUID-3FB0F7B7-F221-43BE-8D29-E36A18EF45C0)" in the Enterprise Manager documentation
- Named Credential requirement
    - Named Credential "EXP\_USER" created in Enterprise Manager for user "EXP\_USER" on database "orcl"
    - To review the credential in OEM console, navigate to "Setup"->"Security"->"Named Credentials"
    - To learn more about named credentials review "[Named Credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en/enterprise-manager/cloud-control/enterprise-manager-cloud-control/13.5/emsec/security-features.html#GUID-345595B0-3FA4-4F2C-A606-596B1A10A13E)" in the Enterprise Manager documentation
- Data Pump directory requirement

    Migration workbench requires a local directory on the source database with sufficient space to host the data pump dump files.
    - Created the following directory on the host: /u01/app/oracle/migration_workbench
    - Created directory object "MWB_DIR" in the source database pointing to this directory
    - Granted read and write privileges on the directory object to user EXP\_USER in the source database
- Compare performance requirement

    SQL Performance Analyzer (SPA) automates the process of assessing the overall effect of a change on the  SQL workload by identifying performance divergence for each SQL statement. A report that shows the net impact on workload performance due to the change is provided. For regressed SQL statements, SQL Performance Analyzer also provides appropriate execution plan details along with tuning recommendations. As a result, you can remedy any negative outcome before the end-users are affected. Furthermore, you can validate -with time and cost savings- that migration will result in net improvement.

    An SQL Tuning Set (STS) containing the SQL and relevant execution metadata from the source database is needed to compare performance before and after the migration. Database Migration Workbench can create an STS from AWR during migration, or you can create one in advance and pass it to the migration procedure.

    - For this lab, an STS was created in advance (SH2STS) by running a workload against the SH2 schema in the source database and capturing the SQL statements executing during the load test
- Upload migration tools

    Migration Workbench uses Instant Client and the Cloud Premigration Advisor Tool (CPAT) as part of its migration toolkit. Enterprise Manager automatically downloads the latest version of the tools when set up with either a MOS Proxy or direct internet connection. The tools can also be uploaded manually as described in [Upload Migration Tools] (<https://docs.oracle.com/en/enterprise-manager/cloud-control/enterprise-manager-cloud-control/13.4/emlcm/upload-migration-tools.html>) in the Migration Workbench documentation.

    - For this lab the migration tools were uploaded in advance. For additional detail on the Cloud Premigration Advisor Tool refer to this MOS document: *Cloud Premigration Advisor Tool (CPAT) Analyzes Databases for Suitability of Cloud Migration (Doc ID 2758371.1)*

    You have now completed this task.

    - Expand the drop-down menu on the right of the activity row
    ![Compare Performance](images/compare-performance.png " ")
    - Click on Compare Performance
15. On the Compare Performance screen:

    Examine the Performance Comparison report to analyze the database performance before and after the migration. The report has 3 sections:
    - General Information: Contains information about the task, workload, execution, and analysis before and after migration. The  comparison metric used is "Elapsed Time"
    - Report Summary: Contains 3 sections:
        - Projected Workload Change Impact: This shows the overall impact of the migration on the SQL workload, the improvement impact, and the regression impact
        - SQL Statement Count: This shows the overall statement count, the number of SQLs that improved, regressed, or were unchanged
        - Top 100 SQL Sorted by Absolute Value of Change Impact on the Workload: This shows the top 100 impacted SQLs with absolute percentage improvement. SQLs highlighted in green have improved performance due to improved execution plans or query costs. Those highlighted in red have regressed due to execution plan change or execution problems (for example query returning no rows or number of rows returned is different in the destination than in source, etc.)

            Check regressed SQLs to see execution statistics, before and after migration change analysis. Understand findings provided for each query to see which factors impacted the regressed SQLs. You can then take action based on findings provided in the Report Details section to improve SQL performance
    - Report Details: Contains detailed execution details for each SQL statement in the STS, including the SQL test, execution frequency, executions statistics, notes, findings, and execution plan before and after the migration

        ![Performance Comparison](images/performance-comparison.png " ")
    - With automated performance optimization option available with Autonomous database, the database ignores existing indexes and dynamically generates new indexes based on workload. To show the performance comparison with no indexes, check the checkbox on the top right of the screen.
    - When you are done with performance comparison, click on "Migration Activities" in the top left of the report to navigate back to the Migration Activities screen
16. On the Migration Activities screen:
    - Expand the drop-down menu on the right of the activity row
    ![Mark Completed](images/mark-completed.png " ")
    - Click Mark as Completed
    - Examine the guidelines on the Confirmation pop-up window, enter any comments as appropriate
    ![Confirmation](images/confirmation.png " ")
    - Click Yes
     ![Marked Completed](images/marked-completed.png " ")
    - Activity is marked completed

    You have now completed this task.

This completes the Lab!
