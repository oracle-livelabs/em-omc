# Enterprise Manager Fundamentals: Monitoring Quick Tour
## Introduction
Oracle Enterprise Manager enables you to get complete monitoring visibility into your IT infrastructure, applications stack and applications that are critical to running your business.

- Single pane of glass to monitor and discover targets, such as Oracle Database, that are running on-premises or in the cloud

- Comprehensive set of predefined performance and health metrics that enables lights-out monitoring of critical components in your environment, such as applications, application servers, databases, as well as the back-end components on which they rely, such as hosts and storage

- Rich set of alerting, incident management and notification capabilities to notify IT staff and integrate with your corporate ticketing systems

- Dynamic Runbooks to triage and resolve your incidents  

- Corrective Actions to auto-correct alerts and minimize service disruption

- Metric Extensions to monitor conditions specific to your environment

- Monitoring Templates to standardize monitoring settings across your fleet

- Administration Groups and Template Collections to enforce monitoring standards and automate monitoring setup in a scalable way

## Task 1: Enterprise Summary

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”. 

    ![Enterprise Manager login](images/enterprise-manager-login-24ai.png " ")

2. Enterprise Summary presents a single pane of glass view of the health of your Enterprise assets. The Overview pane shows the Target Status of your IT estate. The Status section shows aggregated target availability so you can get a sense of what percentage is UP vs DOWN at a quick glance. The Green slice of the pie are your targets that are up. The Red slice of the pie are the targets that are down. Targets in red may be down due to unscheduled outages. Let’s drill down and take a look at them.

     ![Enterprise Manager summary page](images/enterprise-summary/enterprise-summary-page-24ai.png " ") 

3. Click on the Red slice of the pie in the “Status” section. **Note:** You can ignore any differences between the count of targets in the screenshots vs. what you see in your lab environment. The number of targets may vary based on your lab environment.

    ![Enterprise Manager summary page, status section](images/enterprise-summary/pie-chart-red-slice-24ai.png " ")  

   If a dialog pops up, click on ‘Down’ again.

    ![Enterprise Manager summary page, status section](images/enterprise-summary/pie-chart-select-down-again-24ai.png " ")   

4. In Enterprise Manager we have an “All Targets” page, which shows all of the targets being monitored by EM. When we clicked on the Red slice of the pie, we essentially placed a filter on the All Targets page to display only Down targets. From here, you can click on the individual target to go to the Target Home Page and take necessary actions such as starting up a Database Instance.

4. In Incident Manager, you can use any of the Out-of-box Views to quickly filter the list of incidents to the subset you're interested in, e.g., My open incidents and problems. You can create your own views and share with others as well. By default, “All open incidents” view is displayed.

    ![Incident Manager page](images/incident-manager/all-open-incidents-24ai.png " ")

5. We will triage unassigned incidents and then acknowledge and assign an incident to an owner. Click on the incident with Summary text “The database status is UNKNOWN”. Details of the incident will be displayed in the bottom pane.

    ![Incident Manager page](images/incident-manager/db-status-unknown-selected-24ai.png " ")

6. Click on “Open in new tab” link to open the incident on a separate tab. You may need to temporarily allow popups in the browser.
    ![Incident Manager page](images/incident-manager/open-in-new-tab-24ai.png " ")


7. The General tab of this incident contains 5 sections.

      - Incident Details contains information about the incident such as target name, creation date, type, and summary.
      - Metric Data shows the warning and critical thresholds and the last known value of this metric alert event.
      - Tracking provides the priority, status, and ability to manage the lifecycle of the incident.
      - Guided Resolution provides the ability to diagnose and take action to resolve the incident.
      - Runbook Sessions provides options to start, create, or view a runbook session against the incident.

14.	Incident Dashboard provides a holistic view of your incidents. It contains 3 sections.

       - Summary: Count of incidents that are open, fatal, escalated, unassigned, and unacknowledged. These are the incidents that need to be triaged or worked on immediately. Fatal and Escalated count are highlighted in Red by default.
       - Charts: Provides an easy-to-understand look at the current incident distribution and management status for each incident. Drill down capability with stackable filters to slice and dice data any way you like. Customize to add/update/remove charts to provide a personalized view in Incident Manager.
       - Incident List: Shows the open incidents listed in reverse chronological order by last updated time stamp. From this list, you can perform requisite incident lifecycle actions such as escalating, prioritizing, acknowledging, assigning owners, and adding comments to the incident. The incident list will reflect any filters applied.

## Task 3A: Use Dynamic Runbooks for Incidents

For this task, an Incident-Based Dynamic Runbook has already been published for you to use. You will go through the process of starting a Runbook session against a designated **INCIDENT**.

Dynamic Runbooks are documented best practice procedures that IT staff follow to prevent or resolve an issue. In Enterprise Manager, you can create Dynamic Runbooks to encapsulate your best practice procedures in the form of steps that your ITOps teams can execute inside Enterprise Manager in context of a metric or incident. To use runbooks, you choose a runbook, start a Runbook session against a metric or incident, and then follow the steps in the runbook.

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”.

     ![Enterprise Manager login](images/enterprise-manager-login-24ai.png " ")

2. Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Enterprise Manager menu icon](ask-em-images/menu-icon.png " ")

3. Navigate to "Enterprise >> Monitoring >> Incident Manager".

     ![Enterprise Manager welcome page](images/start-runbook-incident/enterprise-to-incident-manager-navigation-menu-24ai.png " ")

4. In Incident Manager, the “All open incidents” view is displayed by default. 

     Click the incident with Summary text “The value of Fast Recovery Area % Used is 70.013”. Details of the incident will be displayed in the bottom pane.
     **Note**: You can ignore any differences in values that you see for the Fast Recovery Area Used(&) in your lab environment vs. what is shown in this workbook.
     **Note**: The Fast Recovery Area (FRA) is a unified storage location for all Oracle Database files related to recovery.  

     ![Highlighted Incident](images/start-runbook-incident/fra-in-incident-manager-24ai.png " ")

5. In the middle pane on the right, you should see a section called "Runbook Sessions".

     Under "Start Runbook Session", select the runbook named “Fast Recovery Area Triage”.

     ![Runbook Sessions section in Incident Manager](images/start-runbook-incident/runbook-sessions-pane-24ai.png " ")

6. You have now started a Runbook session, opened in a new browser tab. Here you can see a detailed view of the steps needed to run the Runbook and triage the issue. Notice incident details are carried over. Also, there is a comments icon next to each step where you can leave comments that can later be accessed by your team.

     ![Incident details carried over to runbook session](images/start-runbook-incident/runbook-session-incident-details.png " ")

7. The Overview & Prerequisites step describes what the Runbook does, and the prerequisites needed to run it. In this lab, the prerequisites have already been completed for you. You should have access to the named credentials: **CDB186\_SYS**, for the target database and **ORACLE**, for the host of the target. 

     Check the checkbox to indicate you have read and completed the step.  

     ![Overview & Prerequisites Step - Part 2](images/start-runbook-incident/overview-prereqs-step-completed.png " ")

8. Click the play icon in Step 2 to review the metric that triggered the incident. The red vertical dotted line indicates when the incident happened. 

     ![Review the Metric - Step 2](images/start-runbook-incident/review-metric-step.png " ") 

9. Notice Step 3 has gear icon displayed instead of the play icon. The gear icon means some input properties are required before you can execute the step. 

     Click the gear icon.

     ![Gear Icon - Step 3](images/start-runbook-incident/check-fra-size-gear-icon.png " ") 

10. Step 3 requires you to specify the named credential for the target database before you can run the step. 

     CLick on the field, select the following credential: **CDB186\_SYS** in the dropdown menu of Named Credential Name. Click Save.

     ![Specify Credentials - Step 3](images/start-runbook-incident/specify-db-cred-pt1-24ai.png " ")     

11. Before running the step, click the hyperlink for “What’s FRA?”. This will open another tab to documentation on Fast Recovery Area. You can add links to external resources or to other EM pages to assist users with additional diagnostic or contextual information.

     ![What's FRA](images/start-runbook-incident/whats-fra-link.png " ")

     ![What's FRA link opened](images/start-runbook-incident/whats-fra-doc.png " ")

12. Close out of the Oracle documentation tab.

13. In Step 3, click the play icon to check the FRA size of the database. 

     It is 8 Gigabytes (GB). However, the FRA size must be set to at least 50GB. Therefore, you will need to increase the FRA size.

     ![Check FRA Size - Step 3](images/start-runbook-incident/check-fra-size-ran.png " ")

14. Before increasing the size, first identify the filesystem used by the FRA. 

     Click the play icon in Step 4.

     ![Identify filesystem - Step 4](images/start-runbook-incident/check-fra-location-before.png " ")

15. A table appears with the FRA filesystem path. This filesystem path will be used in the next Runbook step. 

     ![FRA filesystem path - Step 4](images/start-runbook-incident/check-fra-location-after.png " ")

16. Let's move on to Step 5. Before we can increase to meet the requirements, we should check that the filesystem has enough space to increase the FRA size.

17. Notice another gear icon is displayed instead of the play icon for Step 5. 

     Click the gear icon.

     ![Check filesystem space - Step 5](images/start-runbook-incident/check-filesystem-gear-icon.png " ")

18. Step 5 requires you to specify host credentials before you can run the step. 

     Click on the field, select the following credentials: **ORACLE** in the dropdown menu of Named Credential Name. Click Save.

     ![Specify value complete - Step 5](images/start-runbook-incident/specify-host-cred-pt1-24ai.png " ")

19. Click the play icon. 

     ![Run Step 5](images/start-runbook-incident/check-filesystem-play-icon-before.png " ")

20. There are 342GB available in the filesystem where the FRA is located. This shows that there is enough space for us to increase the FRA size.

     ![342GB available in the filesystem  - Step 5](images/start-runbook-incident/check-filesystem-play-icon-after.png " ")

21. To change the FRA size to 50GB, click the play icon in Step 6. 

     You should see a table that indicates that you have successfully increased the FRA size. Increasing the FRA size allows the FRA percent used to decrease.

     ![Change FRA  - Step 6](images/start-runbook-incident/change-fra-size.png " ")

22. Run Step 7 to view the updated FRA size and to confirm that it has been set to at least 50GB which meets the FRA size required for the database.

     ![Double check FRA size](images/start-runbook-incident/recheck-fra-size.png " ")

23. Step 8 describes the success criteria: once you have completed all the Runbook steps and the FRA is sized appropriately, then this should eventually resolve the issue. 

     **Note:** For the purpose of this lab, the metric incident was simulated and therefore may still remain in Incident Manager after these steps have been run.

     ![Success Criteria - Step 8](images/start-runbook-incident/success-criteria-before.png " ")

24. Check the checkbox in Step 8 to indicate that you have read and completed all the runbook steps. 

     ![Checkbox selected for Success Criteria - Step 8](images/start-runbook-incident/success-criteria-step.png " ")

25. The Runbook remains an active session until you Mark as Done. As an active session, your data will be saved which allows you to go back and run (or rerun) your steps. This is useful for cases where you may want to leave the session halfway through and return to complete it later.

26. Click ‘Mark as Done’ to indicate that you have finished all the steps. Once you Mark as Done, you can no longer re-run any steps, but you can continue to view the session in read-only in order to do any post-mortem analysis.

     ![Mark as Done](images/start-runbook-incident/mark-as-done.png " ")

27. Click OK.

     ![Mark as Done - OK](images/start-runbook-incident/mark-as-done-pop-up.png " ")

28. Your runbook session will be kept for 14 days to enable you to do postmortem analysis. You can save it for a longer period by going to the Actions menu and extending its expiraiton date.

     ![Actions - Complete Runbook Session](images/start-runbook-incident/runbook-sessions.png " ")
     

## Task 3B: Create Dynamic Runbooks for Incidents

For this task, a Dynamic Runbook **draft** has already been created in the context of an incident. You will go through the process of modifying the Runbook and later publishing it to be used by others.

Runbooks are documented best practice procedures in the form of ordered steps that IT staff follow to prevent or resolve an issue. To create a Dynamic Runbook, you can create it in context of an incident or metric. This runbook in development is called a runbook draft. The runbook draft will contain the incident or metric context against which you can develop and test the runbook steps. Once runbook creation and testing are completed, the runbook can be published for general use.

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”.

     ![Enterprise Manager login](images/enterprise-manager-login-24ai.png " ")

2. Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Enterprise Manager menu icon](ask-em-images/menu-icon.png " ")

3. Navigate to "Enterprise >> Monitoring >> Runbooks".

     ![Navigate to Runbooks](images/create-runbook-incident/runbooks-menu-24ai.png " ")

4. The Runbooks page has Draft Runbooks and Published Runbooks. By default, the Drafts tab is opened. You can create a Runbook through this Runbooks page, directly against an incident in the Incident Manager page, or directly against a metric in the All Metrics page. 

     Under the Drafts tab, select the "**New Runbook**" link. This is the Runbook draft that was created for you and that you will modify.
     
     ![Select New Runbook Draft](images/create-runbook-incident/runbook-drafts.png " ")

5. At the top of the page, the previous incident details are carried over. This is the incident that was selected to create a Runbook draft on. 

     You can optionally edit the Runbook name and Description using the pencil icons next to them.

     ![New Runbook Draft Page](images/create-runbook-incident/runbook-incident-details.png " ")

6. There is an ‘Add a Step’ drop-down menu, where you can select the desired step type you want to define. There are five step types: Note, Metric Data, Repository SQL, Target SQL and OS Command. We have already added the steps for you in this Runbook draft.

     ![Add Step - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/add-a-step.png " ")

7. In the Overview and Prerequisites step you can specify the purpose of the Runbook, and any prerequisites needed to successfully execute the steps. You can include simple formatting via markdown language.

     Select the pencil icon to edit Step 1 (Overview and Prerequisites).

     ![Step 1 Overview and Prereq - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/edit-overview.png " ")  

8. In Step 1, you are going to make the first sentence a header, add a line underneath it and then add a variable to the text. 

     Copy the following and replace the current text in Step 1: 

     **\### This runbook can be used to triage and resolve FRA incidents.**
     
     **\---**

     **Prior to beginning:**
     
     **1. Make sure you have been granted access to the named credentials for the target database $ora\_target\_name on which the FRA incident has occurred and for the host of the target**
     **2. Use that named credential values for the steps that require DB named credentials and host named credentials**

     ![Step 1 Final Edits - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/overview-prereq-edits.png " ")  

9. Select Save Step. Step 1 should now look like this:
     
     ![New Step 1 - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/overview-after.png " ") 

10. Step 2 is a Metric Data step which is used to show the metric time series chart. 

     Click the pencil icon.

     ![Step 2 - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/step-2-before.png " ") 

11. In this step you are going to modify the time range of the metric data in the chart. 

     Click on the Time Range field. 
     
     Leave the Start Time as "**evt\_time – 1d**" 
     
     Change the End Time to "**evt\_time + 1d**". 
     
     **Note:** evt\_time represents the time when the event (and its incident) was triggered, and you are changing it to show the day before and after the event was triggered. 
     
     Select Done.

     ![Step 2 Change Time Range - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/time-range.png " ")

12. Click the Run button to preview the metric graph. This should now show the graph and display the trend of the metric before and after it triggered the incident.

     ![Step 2 Run to view Graph](images/create-runbook-incident/graph-preview.png " ")

13. Click Save Step to save your changes for Step 2.

     ![Save step 2](images/create-runbook-incident/step-2-save.png " ")

14. A graph now displays with a red vertical dotted line to indicate when the incident was triggered.

     ![New Step 2 - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/step-2-after.png " ")

15. Step 3 is a Target SQL Step. It allows you to execute SQL against any database target. 

     Select the pencil icon.

     ![Step 3 - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/step-3-before.png " ")

16. You can add links to external resources or to other EM pages to assist users with additional diagnostic or contextual information. In this step we will add a link to an external FRA doc.

     Add the following to the instruction text in Step 3: 


     \[What's FRA?](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/creating-and-configuring-an-oracle-database.html#GUID-CE434293-0956-4E62-8D3F-CD92CE66B7D8)

     ![Step 3 - What's FRA After](images/create-runbook-incident/whats-fra-after.png " ")

17. A SQL query has already been added to check the FRA size. 

     Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Run to test the query. 

     ![Step 3 - Run SQL Query](images/create-runbook-incident/step-3-run.png " ")

18. Select Save Step. The "What’s FRA?" text is now hyperlinked to the FRA doc and the SQL output is displayed.

19. Step 4 is another Target SQL step. Data from this step will be saved to a variable for use in another step. You will go through the process of saving the SQL query output into an author-defined variable that was previously created. 

     Select the pencil icon.

     ![Step 4 - Check FRA Location on Filesystem](images/create-runbook-incident/step-4-before.png " ")

20. Scroll to the bottom of the step and click the Run button to preview the SQL query results.

     ![Step 4 - Preview Query Output Pt.2](images/create-runbook-incident/step-4-run-after.png " ")

21. Select the "Save to Variables" tab.

     ![Step 4 - Save to Var](images/create-runbook-incident/save-to-var-tab.png " ")

22. Click on the cell under the Filesystem header. 

     ![Step 4 - Select Cell to Save Var](images/create-runbook-incident/filesystem-header.png " ")

23. Under the dropdown for "Runbook Variable", select the pre-defined variable named "FRA Destination (user\_fra\_dest)". Select "Save".

     ![Step 4 - Select FRA Destination Var](images/create-runbook-incident/fra-dest-var.png " ")

24. Now whenever this step is run the Runbook variable, FRA Destination (user-fra-dest), will be populated with the value from the selected cell (i.e., the output of the SQL query). 

     Select Save Step.

     ![Step 4 - Save Step](images/create-runbook-incident/save-step-4.png " ")

25. Step 5 is an OS Command Step. This step type allows you to execute a single operation or execute a script as a part of the step definition. 

     Select the pencil icon.

     ![Step 5 - Edit Step](images/create-runbook-incident/step-5-before.png " ")

26. Let’s create a variable that will contain the credentials that will need to be specified by the runbook session user when running this step. 

     **Note:** Notice that the FRA Destination variable from Step 4 is used in both the instruction text and script for Step 5.

27. Navigate to the Variables section on the right. In the "Author Defined" section select the "Add Variable" button. 

     ![Step 5 - Scroll to Author Defined Var Pt.2](images/create-runbook-incident/scroll-up-after.png " ")

28. You will see a pop-up box labeled Add a Runbook Variable. 
     - In the Name field, enter "**user\_host\_credential**".
     - In the Display Name field enter "**Host Credential**".
     - In the Value used in the Draft field, enter "**ORACLE**".
     - And for the Value used in a Runbook Session field, select the dropdown option "**Specified by the session user or by running a step**". 

     ![Step 5 - Add a Var Pop-Up](images/create-runbook-incident/add-a-var-popup.png " ") 

29. Click OK to save the variable. 

      ![Step 5 - Confirm a Var Pop-Up](images/create-runbook-incident/confirm-a-var-popup.png " ") 

30. Once the variable is saved, it should appear in the Variables section under ‘Author Defined’.

     ![Step 5 - Var Saved](images/create-runbook-incident/new-var.png " ") 

31. Currently, the "Named Credential" field is hardcoded to always use the name credential value **ORACLE** to run the step. 

     Select the ‘Named Credential’ field.

     ![Step 5 - Hardocded Var](images/create-runbook-incident/hardcoded-cred.png " ") 

32. Select the option to ‘Use existing value from variable’.

     ![Step 5 - Use existing value from Variable](images/create-runbook-incident/use-existing.png " ") 

33. Using the dropdown options, select the variable you just created that is labeled ‘user\_host\_credential’. Select Done.

     ![Step 5 - Selected Host Cred](images/create-runbook-incident/user-host-cred.png " ") 

34. Now this step will require the session user to specify the host credentials, **ORACLE**, before they are permitted to run this step. 

     ![Step 5 - New Var Saved and Used](images/create-runbook-incident/var-saved.png " ")

35. Scroll down to the Run preview section. Run the step to preview the script output and then select Save Step.

     ![Step 5 - Run to Preview](images/create-runbook-incident/step-5-run.png " ")

36. You have now finished making edits to the Runbook and can publish it so that it can be used by others. Your edits are automatically saved. 

     At the top of the Runbook draft page click on the “Runbooks” link to go back to the Runbooks page.

     ![Link back to Runbooks Drafts](images/create-runbook-incident/runbooks-link.png " ")

     ![Published Runbook - New Runbook](images/create-runbook-incident/published.png " ")


## Task 3C: Use Dynamic Runbooks for Metrics

For this task, a Metric-Based Dynamic Runbook has already been published for you to use. You will go through the process of starting a Runbook session against a designated **METRIC**.

Runbooks are documented best practice procedures that IT staff follow to prevent or resolve an issue. In Enterprise Manager, you can create Dynamic Runbooks to encapsulate your best practice procedures in the form of steps that your ITOps teams can execute inside Enterprise Manager in context of a metric or incident. To use runbooks, you choose a runbook, start a Runbook session against a metric or incident, and then follow the steps in the runbook.

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”.

     ![Enterprise Manager login](images/enterprise-manager-login-24ai.png " ")

2. Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Enterprise Manager menu icon](ask-em-images/menu-icon.png " ")

3. Navigate to “Targets >> Databases” to see the list of Database targets.     

     ![Databases Menu Option](images/start-runbook-metric/databases-menu-24ai.png " ")

4. Once at the Database targets page, locate and expand **cdb186.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com** to view its pluggable databases (PDBs). Select the PDB target with the name, **cdb186.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com_TESTPDB**.

     ![PDBs on Database Targets Page](images/start-runbook-metric/databases-page-expanded-24ai.png " ")

5. This takes you to the target homepage for the PDB target.

     ![PDB Target Homepage](images/start-runbook-metric/testpdb-homepage-24ai.png " ")

6. From the homepage, navigate to ‘Oracle Database >> Monitoring >> All Metrics’.

     ![Navigate to All Metrics](images/start-runbook-metric/all-metrics-menu.png " ")

7. Under All Metrics find the "Tablespace Full" metric group and expand it. Select the ‘Tablespace Space Used (%)’ metric.

     ![Locate Tablespace Full Metric Group](images/start-runbook-metric/tablespace-space-used-selected.png " ")

8. Click on the "DEMO" tablespace row in the Tablespace Space Used (%) table to see its metric data. 

     ![Select DEMO Tablespace](images/start-runbook-metric/demo-tablespace-selected-24ai.png " ")

9. Notice that the Last Known Value for the metric is 84% and the warning and critical thresholds are 90% and 97%. With this metric value close to the thresholds, use a runbook to triage this before an alert is triggered and an incident is created. 

      ![Compare Metric Thresholds](images/start-runbook-metric/last-known-value-24ai.png " ")
      
10. Navigate to the Runbook Sessions section. 

     ![Current Sessions](images/start-runbook-metric/runbook-sessions-section.png " ")

     For lab purposes, locate the **Current Sessions** section and select the runbook for **Database Tablespace Full Triage: 2025-07-31 09:44:49** to open an existing runbook session. 

      ![Current Sessions](images/start-runbook-metric/current-sessions-24ai.png " ")

11. A runbook session appears in a new browser tab. Here you can see a detailed view of the steps needed to run the runbook to triage a possible tablespace full issue in advance. Notice the metric details are carried over.

      ![New Session opened](images/start-runbook-metric/metric-details-24ai.png " ")

12. The Overview & Prerequisites step describes what the Runbook does, and the prerequisites needed to run it. In this lab, the prerequisites have already been completed for you. You should have access to the named credentials: **CDB186_PDB**, for the target database and **ORACLE**, for the host of the target. 

     **Check the checkbox** to indicate you have read and completed the step.
     
     ![Completed Step 1](images/start-runbook-metric/overview-prereq-24ai.png " ")

13. **Click the play icon in Step 2** to review the trend of the tablespace full metric. Note if there is an increasing trend.

      ![Review Metric Trend](images/start-runbook-metric/review-trend-24ai.png " ")

14. Notice for Step 3 a gear icon is displayed instead of the play icon. The gear icon means some input properties are required before you can execute the step. 

     **Click the gear icon**.

      ![Step 3 - Gear Icon](images/start-runbook-metric/step-3-gear-icon-24ai.png " ")

15. Step 3 requires you to specify PDB named credentials before you can run the step. 

     Click on the credentials field, select the following PDB named credential: **CDB186_PDB**. Click Save.

      ![Step 3 - Enter Credentials](images/start-runbook-metric/pdb-cred-after-24ai.png " ")

16. **Click the play icon** to find out which tables in the tablespace are consuming the most space.
      
      ![Step 3 - Play icon](images/start-runbook-metric/step-3-play-icon-24ai.png " ")

17. A list of tables in the ‘DEMO’ tablespace appears. From the output, the ‘Student’ table appears to be consuming the most space. According to the runbook, review the data in the tables consuming the most space to see if there is any data that can be deleted or if the table itself can be deleted. 

     Assume that all the data in all the tables are necessary and continue to Step 4.

      ![Step 3 - Ran](images/start-runbook-metric/tables-consuming-space-24ai.png " ")

18. If you need to increase the tablespace size, first identify the filesystem that is used by the tablespace. 

     **Click the play icon in Step 4**. The filesystem path output will be used in Step 5.

      ![Identify Filesystem Path](images/start-runbook-metric/identify-filesystem-24ai.png " ")

19. Notice for Step 5 another gear icon is displayed instead of the play icon. 

     **Click on the gear icon**. 

      ![Check Filesystem for available space](images/start-runbook-metric/step-5-gear-icon-24ai.png " ")

20. Step 5 requires you to specify host named credentials before you can run the step. 
     
     Click on the credentials field, select the host named credential: **ORACLE** under the dropdown menu of Named Credential. Click Save.

      ![Check Filesystem for available space](images/start-runbook-metric/oracle-credential-24ai.png " ")

21. **Click the play icon** to check the filesystem, that was identified in Step 4, for available space. There are 342G available in the filesystem which means that you have enough space to increase the size of the tablespace if needed.

      ![Output of checking filesystem size](images/start-runbook-metric/step-5-ran-24ai.png " ")

22. **Run Step 6** to note if there is a decreasing filesystem space available trend that could impact future growth of tablespace. 

      ![Review filesystem space](images/start-runbook-metric/review-filesystem-space-24ai.png " ")

23. Scroll to Step 7. If needed and there is space available in the filesystem, add another 100MG datafile from the Tablespace page. Select the hyperlink to navigate to the ‘Tablespace Page’.

     **Note**: Runbooks support navigation links to other Enterprise Manager pages in step instructions for further triaging purposes.

      ![Select hyperlink to Tablespace page](images/start-runbook-metric/step-7-add-datafile-24ai.png " ")  

24. A new browser tab opens with a database login screen. 
     
     Login to the database using the PDB named credential: **CDB186_PDB**.

      ![Database Login Page](images/start-runbook-metric/database-login.png " ") 

25. This is the Tablespace page where you can add new datafiles to the tablespace. For lab purposes, we will **NOT** go through the workflow to add a new datafile to the tablespace. 

      ![Tablespace Page](images/start-runbook-metric/tablespace-page.png " ") 

26. Close out of the current tab to return to the Runbook steps.

27. Check the checkbox to indicate you completed the step.

      ![Completed Step 7](images/start-runbook-metric/step-7-checked-24ai.png " ") 

28.	The Runbook remains an active session until you Mark as Done. As an active session, your data will be saved which allows you to go back and run (or rerun) your steps. This is useful for cases where you may want to leave the session halfway through and return to complete it later.

29.	Click “Mark as Done” to indicate that you have gone through all the steps. Once you Mark as Done, you can no longer re-run any steps, but you can view the session in read-only to complete a post-mortem analysis.

      ![Click Mark as Done](images/start-runbook-metric/mark-as-done-24ai.png " ") 

30. Click OK.

      ![Mark as Done - OK](images/start-runbook-metric/mark-as-done-popup.png " ")

31. Your runbook session will be kept for 14 days to enable you to do postmortem analysis.  You can save it for a longer period by going to the Actions menu and extending its expiration date.

## Task 3D: Dynamic Runbooks for Notification Backlog (Universal Context) 

Dynamic Runbooks are documented best practice procedures in the form of executable steps that ITOps teams follow to prevent or resolve an issue. Dynamic Runbooks can be executed inside Enterprise Manager (EM) in context of a metric, incident, or any other EM context (universal context).

A universal context runbook can be used for any functional area in EM.  

As an example of a universal context runbook, you will review the Triage Notification Backlog runbook.

     ![Database target home page](images/emmonlab3step4.png " ")

6. Oracle ships with out-of-box metric threshold and collection settings for different target types.  You can further customize these based on your requirements. Here are some Best Practices recommendations:
      - Disable collection for metrics you don’t care about.
      - Set thresholds only on metrics you want to be alerted on.
      - If these metric settings apply to multiple targets, save the modified metric settings and apply to targets using monitoring templates.

![Database target home page, metric and collection settings](images/emmonlab3step5.png " ")

7. By default, the "Metrics with thresholds" view is displayed. This view will show metrics with a Warning or Critical threshold defined.

     ![Database target home page, all metric](images/metric-settings/dump-area-used-background-24ai.png " ")

17.	You should see the metric data for Dump Area Used(%) for the background processes.  By default, the last 24 hours are shown but you can change time periods using the View Data dropdown.  In the metric chart, click on Options to view different options for the chart, then click on the Show Thresholds option.

     ![Database target home page, all metric](images/metric-settings/show-thresholds-24ai.png " ")

18. The Warning and Critical thresholds for the metric will now be shown with the chart as yellow and red lines respectively.  As you review the metric, you can also visually see how close the metric values are to its Warning and Critical thresholds. Notice the metric has passed the new Warning threshold of 85. When the next metric collection occurs, the metric will be evaluated against the new Warning threshold of 85 and should generate a Warning alert. (Note: You do not have to wait for the alert, you can move on to the next lab).

     ![Database target home page, all metric](images/metric-settings/warning-and-critical-shown-24ai.png " ")


## Task 5: Corrective Actions

Corrective Actions automates response to metric alerts and events. A Corrective Action can start the DB listener when it unexpectedly goes down or it can run shell scripts to collect diagnostic data. You can create a custom Corrective Action once and grant access for other Admins to use. We ship with a long list of pre-defined Corrective Actions to get you started.

6. This Metric Extension was created to detect run-away queries. While it has already been created, we will walk through the steps of how a metric extension is created.

     In the General Properties step, we specify the metric Name, the Adapter which is a method for collecting metric data (in our example we use SQL), and the metric Collection Schedule which is 15 minutes in our example.

     **Click Next**.
     
     ![Enterprise Monitoring, general properties step](images/general-properties.png " ")

7. In Adapter step, we specify the SQL query that will be used to collect the metric data. The SQL query is expected to return a table of data with one or more columns.

     **Click Next**.

     ![Enterprise Monitoring, adapter step](images/adapter-step.png " ")

8. In the Columns step, we describe the different columns of the table of data returned by the SQL query. For each column, we provide a name, specify if it will be used as a key (unique identifier for the row of data) or contain data, define the data type, and unit. You can enable alerts on any column by specifying the alert comparison operator and warning and critical thresholds.

     **Click Next**.

     ![Enterprise Monitoring, columns step](images/columns-step.png " ")

9. In the Credentials step, we identify the credentials used to execute the metric. We will keep the default option of using the monitoring credentials of the target on which the metric will be deployed.

     **Click Next**.

     ![Enterprise Monitoring, credentials step](images/credentials-step.png " ")

10. In the Test step, we can test our Metric Extension against some targets. Click Add to select targets for testing.

    ![Enterprise Monitoring, metric extensions page](images/emmonlab5step18.png " ")

## Task 7: Monitoring Templates

Monitoring templates enable you to maintain standardized monitoring settings across the targets in your enterprise.  You can define the monitoring settings once in a template, then apply these settings to many targets. When a change is made to a template, you can reapply the template to propagate the new changes. The apply operation can be automated using Administration Groups and Template Collections. For any target, you can also have metric threshold settings specific to that target and prevent it from being overwritten by a template.

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”.

    ![Enterprise monitoring, monitoring templates page](images/emmonlab6step13.png " ")

## Task 8: Administration Groups and Template Collections

Administration Groups simplify the process of setting up targets for monitoring. First, define the set of Administration Groups where targets in each group have the same monitoring settings. Next for each Administration Group, define the set of monitoring templates, combine them in a Template Collection, and associate it with the appropriate Administration Group. Once that’s done, simply add the target to the appropriate Administration Group, and Enterprise Manager will automatically apply the associated monitoring settings to the target as it joins the group.

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”.

    ![Enterprise manager login](images/enterprise-manager-login-24ai.png " ")

2. Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Enterprise Manager menu icon](ask-em-images/menu-icon.png " ")

3. Navigate to "Setup >> Add Target >> Administration Groups".
 
    ![Enterprise manager welcome page](images/emmonlab7step2.png " ")

4. Click on the Overview tab.

    ![Administration Groups page, overview tab](images/emmonlab7step3.png " ") 

5. The Overview tab of Administration Groups and Template Collections provides an introduction of how to get started along with detailed steps to walk you through the process. For the purpose of this lab, we have already created the hierarchy, template collections and associations. However, we will look at each step to see how the Administration Group was designed and constructed.

    ![Administration Groups page, overview tab](images/emmonlab7step4.png " ") 

6. There are 4 steps involved to setup an Administration Group and Template Collection.
     - Step 1: Setup the Administration Groups Hierarchy
     - Step 2: Create Template Collections
     - Step 3: Associate Template Collections to Administration Groups
     - Step 4: Synchronize the targets with the selected items

    ![Administration Groups page, overview tab](images/emmonlab7step5.png " ") 

7. Click on the Hierarchy tab.

    ![Administration Groups page, overview tab](images/emmonlab7step6.png " ") 

8. The Hierarchy tab is where you design the levels of your Administration Group hierarchy. Logically, you can think of the top-level group in the hierarchy as a group containing all the targets.  Next consider how you would sub-divide this group of all targets into different sub-groups based on their monitoring settings.  For example, production targets that have one set of monitoring settings would be in one sub-group, and test targets that have a different set of monitoring settings would be in a different sub-group.  These sub-groups represent the next level in the administration group hierarchy.  
To create this hierarchy, use target properties to define the membership criteria for the groups at each level in the hierarchy.  For our example, we used Lifecycle Status target property (with values of Production and Test) to define the membership criteria of the Production and Test groups respectively.

![Administration Groups page, hierarchy tab](images/emmonlab7step7.png " ") 

9. Click on the Template Collections tab.

     ![Administration Groups page, hierarchy tab](images/emmonlab7step8.png " ") 

10. Template Collections is a combination of Monitoring Templates and Compliance Standards that are applied to targets upon joining an Administration Group. In this lab, we have already created two template collections. Highlight “Non-Production Template Collection” and click View.

     ![Administration Groups page, template collections tab](images/emmonlab7step9.png " ") 

11.	The Non-Production Template Collection contains two Monitoring Templates. Click OK once you are done reviewing the templates.

     - Dev\_Test\_PDB\_Monitoring\_Template: This monitoring template will be applied to Pluggable Database targets that join the Admin Group with their Lifecycle Status target property defined as "Test".

     - Dev\_Test\_DB\_Instance\_Monitoring\_Template: This monitoring template will be applied to Database Instance targets that join the Admin Group with their Lifecycle Status target property defined as "Test".

     ![Administration Groups page, template collections tab](images/emmonlab7step10.png " ") 

12.	Highlight “Production Template Collection” and click View.

     ![Administration Groups page, template collections tab](images/emmonlab7step11.png " ") 

13.	The Production Template Collection contains 3 Monitoring Templates. Click OK once you are done reviewing the templates.

     - Prod\_PDB\_Monitoring\_Template: This monitoring template will be applied to Pluggable Database targets that join the Admin Group with their Lifecycle Status target property defined as "Production".

     - Prod\_DB\_Instance\_Monitoring\_Template: This monitoring template will be applied to Database Instance targets that join the Admin Group with their Lifecycle Status target property defined as "Production".

     - Prod\_Host\_Monitoring\_Template: This monitoring template will be applied to Host targets that join the Admin Group with their Lifecycle Status target property defined as "Production".

14.	Click on the Associations tab.

     ![Administration Groups page, template collections tab](images/emmonlab7step13.png " ") 

15.	The Associations tab is where the association between Template Collections and Administration Groups take place. In this lab we have already associated the “Production Template Collection” with “Prod-Grp” Admin Group. Any target that joins “Prod-Grp” Admin Group will automatically have the Monitoring Templates from “Production Template Collection” applied.

     ![Administration Groups page, associations tab](images/emmonlab7step14.png " ") 

16.	We will go through the exercise of associating a Template Collection with “Test-Grp”. Select “Test-Grp” Admin Group and click on "Associate Template Collection".

20.	Click on the “Test-Grp” group name to go to its homepage.

     ![Administration Groups page, associations tab](images/emmonlab7step19.png " ")

21.	In the group homepage for Test-Grp, review the Synchronization Status region.  Notice there are 3 targets pending synchronization (i.e. applying of templates) and it is scheduled for a future date specified in the Next Synchronization field.    Instead of waiting for the synchronization to occur, let’s do the synchronization process now by clicking on the “Start Synchronization” button..

     ![Group homepage](images/emmonlab7step20.png " ") 

22.	After about a minute or so, you should see the 3 targets synchronized.   You may have to hit the page refresh button to see this.

     ![Group homepage](images/emmonlab7step21.png " ") 

23.	We will add a target to “Test-Grp” Admin Group and confirm the monitoring template has been being applied to the target. Navigate to “Targets >> Databases”.

     ![Group homepage with navigation to databases page](images/emmonlab7step22.png " ") 

24.	Click on “cd186.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com” target.

     ![Databases page](images/emmonlab7step23.png " ") 

25.	Navigate to “Oracle Database >> Target Setup >> Properties”.

     ![Group homepage](images/emmonlab7step28.png " ")

## Task 9: Incident Rules

Incident Rules specify actions to be taken on events.  For example, when a target down event occurs, you might want to create an incident for the event and send email notification on the  incident. A rule set is a collection of these rules and they apply to a common set of targets such as hosts, databases, groups. Enterprise Manager ships with out-of-the-box rule sets to get you started. Out-of-the-box rule sets have a Lock icon next to them because they cannot be modified. We recommend making a copy of the rule set, and modifying the copy to suit your needs. Alternatively, you can create new rule sets from scratch.

1. Log into an Enterprise Manager VM (using provided IP). The Enterprise Manager credentials are “emadmin/welcome1”.

     ![enterprise manager login](images/enterprise-manager-login-24ai.png " ")

2. Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Enterprise Manager menu icon](ask-em-images/menu-icon.png " ")

3. Navigate to "Setup >> Incidents >> Incident Rules".

     ![enterprise manager login page](images/emmonlab8step2.png " ")

4. Expand “Incident management rule set for all targets” rule set.

     ![incident rules page](images/emmonlab8step3.png " ") 

5. The “Incident management rule set for all targets” rule set covers common use cases for which incidents should be created such as target down events or critical metric alerts. You can enable or disable the rules based on your monitoring requirements. If you want to change a rule, you should make a copy of the rule set and modify it.

   Highlight "Create incident for critical metric alerts" and click View.

     ![incident rules page](images/emmonlab8step4.png " ") 

6. The "Create incident for critical metric alerts" incident rule will create an incident when the event type is a metric alert and the Severity is Critical.

     ![incident rules page](images/emmonlab8step5.png " ") 

7. Click on the “Incident Rules” link to go back to Incident Rules page.

     ![incident rules page](images/emmonlab8step6.png " ") 

8. In this lab, we will create a new rule set and add a rule to notify the DBA when there is a critical DB alert. Click on “Create Rule Set”.

     ![incident rules page](images/emmonlab8step9.png " ") 

9.	Provide a name for the Rule Set and select the following target types.

     - Database Instance
     - Pluggable Database

     ![incident rules, create rule set page](images/emmonlab8step10.png " ")

11.	Keep the default selection of "Incoming events and updates to events" and click Continue.

     ![incident rules, create rule set page with select type of rule to create pop-up](images/emmonlab8step12.png " ") 

12.	Configure the following fields and click Next. 
     - Type: Metric Alert, All events of type Metric Alert. 
     - Severity: In Critical. 

     ![incident rules, create rule set page](images/emmonlab8step13.png " ") 

13.	Click Add in the "Create New Rule: Add Actions" page.

     ![incident rules, create rule set page](images/emmonlab8step14.png " ") 

14.	Configure the following fields and click Continue.                     

    - Conditions for actions
        - Keep the default of “Always execute the actions”
    - Create Incident or Update Incident  
        - Click on option “Create incident (if not associated with one)”

16.	Enter a name for the Rule and click Next.

     ![incident rules, create rule set specify name and description page](images/emmonlab8step17.png " ") 

17.	Click Continue.

     ![incident rules, create rule set review page](images/incident-rules/review-rule.png " ") 

18.	You’ll be brought back to the main page for Create Rule Set.  Scroll down to the Rules section and click on ‘Create’.

     ![incident rules, create rule set page](images/incident-rules/create-new-rule.png " ") 
 
19.	Choose the option “Newly created incidents or updates to incidents” and click Continue.

     ![incident rules, create rule set page with select type of rule to create pop-u](images/emmonlab8step20.png " ") 

20.	Choose “Specific Incidents”.   And under this option,  select “Rules that created the incidents” and then select the rule that you just created in the previous step.   Then click Next.

     ![incident rules, create rule set select incidents page](images/emmonlab8step21.png " ")  

21.	Click ‘Add’.

     ![incident rules, create rule set add actions page](images/emmonlab8step22.png " ") 

22.	In the "Email To” field,  specify DB TARGET USER.       Then click Continue.

     ![incident rules, create rule set add actions page](images/emmonlab8step23.png " ") 

23.	Click Next.

     ![incident rules, create rule set add actions page](images/emmonlab8step24.png " ") 

24.	Enter a name for the Rule and click Next.

     ![incident rules, create rule set specify name and description page](images/emmonlab8step25.png " ") 

25.	Click Continue.

     ![incident rules, create rule set review page](images/emmonlab8step26.png " ") 

26.	Click Save.

     ![incident rules, create rule set page](images/emmonlab8step27.png " ")

27.	The new rule set now appears at the bottom of the Incident Rules page.

     ![incident rules page](images/incident-rules/rule-saved.png " ") 

    **Note:**  Rule Sets are evaluated and executed in the order specified under the Order column.  When you create your own rule set that has an action to create an incident, you typically want to reorder it such that its order is ahead of the out-of-box rule sets.  This is to ensure that your rule set that creates the incident will be used instead of the out-of-box rule set.   However, for this lab exercise, we can skip this step.

## Task 10A: Event Compression Policies

Event Compression is the process of grouping (i.e., compressing) multiple correlated events into a smaller subset of actionable incidents. An Event Compression Policy defines the specific set of related events that should be grouped together. Before incident creation, Event Compression Policies work with Incident Rule Sets to determine if incoming events should be grouped and compressed into a single incident.

1. Log into Enterprise Manager using the credentials **emadmin/welcome1**. 

    ![Enterprise Manager login](ask-em-images/em24-login.png " ")

2. Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Enterprise Manager menu icon](ask-em-images/menu-icon.png " ")

3. Navigate to **Enterprise > Monitoring > Incident Manager**.

    ![Navigate to Enterprise menu option](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/enterprise.png " ")

    ![Navigate to Incident Manager](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/monitoring.png " ") 

4. Let’s take a look at an example of an incident with event compression. 

    **Select the incident with the summary text: There are 5 target\_availability events on members of db19c.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com\_sys.**

    ![Select incident](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/incident.png " ")

5. Click **Open in new tab**.

    ![Open in new tab](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/open-in-new-tab.png " ")

6. From here, take a closer look at the incident details to view:
    - The number of events in the incident
    - The Incident Rule and RuleSet used to create the incident
    - The Event Compression Policy used to group the events into this incident
    - The list of events in the incident

    ![Incident Details](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/incident-details.png " ")

7.	Now let’s take a look at how to use and create Event Compression Policies to create these compressed incidents.

8.	Click the **hamburger menu** icon.

    ![Navigate back to menu](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/navigate-back-to-menu.png " ")

9.	Navigate to **Setup > Incidents > Event Compression Policies**.

    ![Setup menu option](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/setup.png " ")

    ![Event Compression Policies menu option](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/event-compression-policies.png " ")

10. There are 7 Oracle-provided Event Compression Policies. You can also author your own policies for custom compression requirements.

    ![Event Compression Policies page](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/policy-page.png " ")

11.	Let’s take a look at the policy that created the incident with event compression that we previously viewed.

    **Click the policy with the name: Target down events for a database system and its members**.

    ![Select custom policy](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/custom-policy.png " ")

12. Here you can view the criteria for how the events were grouped together into the incident.

    ![Custom policy details](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/custom-policy-details.png " ")

13. Click the **X** icon to exit from the screen.

    ![Leave custom policy details](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/leave-custom-policy.png " ")

14. Now, we will review and edit a custom policy. In this lab, you will edit a custom draft policy that has already been created for you. This policy groups multiple event types into a single incident.

15. Select **Actions > Edit** for the following policy: **Target down, metric alert, and metric evaluation error events for a database system and its members**.

    ![Locate new policy details](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/new-policy.png " ")

    ![Edit new policy details](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/edit-new-policy.png " ")

16.	In the Event Compression Logic sub-section, you can see the policy applies to:
    - Multiple event types: Target Availability/Down, Metric Alert, and Metric Evaluation Error
    - Target Types: Database System, Database Instance, Pluggable Database
    - Event Severity: Fatal and Critical
    - Time Window: 60 minutes
    
    ![New policy details](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/new-policy-details.png " ") 

17. Locate the dropdowns under the header **Compress into One Incident By**. This determines the criteria for grouping the events.

    ![Locate dropdown to group the events](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/compress-by.png " ") 

18. Select the dropdown for **select Group type**. 

    Search for and click on **Database System**. 
    
    This ensures that the specified events for the Database Instance, Pluggable Database, and Database System targets will be grouped into an incident based on the Database System.

    ![Group events by Database System](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/database-system.png " ") 

19. Click **Save**.

    ![Save new policy](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/save-new-policy.png " ") 

20. The custom policy you edited is still in a Draft status. 

    ![Draft policy](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/new-policy-draft.png " ") 

21. Continue to **Task 10B: Event Compression Analysis** to test out the policy, publish it and enable it for use by other EM administrators.


## Task 10B: Event Compression Analysis

**Complete Task 10A: Event Compression Policies prior to beginning this task.**

Event Compression is the process of grouping (i.e., compressing) multiple correlated events into a smaller subset of actionable incidents. An Event Compression Analysis uses historical monitoring data from your environment to analyze the impact Event Compression Policies would have had on your actual incidents had these policies been enabled. 

1. Before publishing and enabling your policy (created in **Task 10A: Event Compression Policies**) for use, test it out using the Event Compression Analysis tool.

2. First **enable** the policy for testing using the toggle button.

    ![Toggle the enable button](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/disabled-toggle.png " ")

    ![Submit the enable policy button](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/submit-enablement.png " ")

    ![Policy is now enabled](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/enabled-toggle.png " ")

3. Click the **Event Compression Analysis** link.

    ![Select Event Compression Analysis link](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/link-to-analysis.png " ")

4. The Event Compression Analysis uses real events from your environment to test the effectiveness of these Event Compression Policies against your own events.

    To begin a new analysis, click **Start New Analysis**.

    ![Start new analysis](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/start-new-analysis.png " ")

6. Enter the following in the pop-up that displays:
    - Name: **Analysis for DB System and its members**
    - Analyze events from these targets:
        - In the dropdown for **Select a Group**, select: **Prod DB Targets**
    - Events occurred within this time range:
        - From: **07/14/2025**
        - To: **07/28/2025**
    - Click **Include Draft Policy** so that your draft policy is used in the analysis

    At the end, your Compression Policy Analysis criteria should look like the following:

    ![Analysis entry](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/analysis-entry.png " ")

7. Click **Start Analysis**. 

    ![Start analysis](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/analysis-entry-start.png " ")

8. A job is submitted that will run the analysis. 

    It takes a few seconds for the analysis to complete so **Refresh your browser** to see analysis results.

    ![Analysis job is ran](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/refresh-browser.png " ")

9. Click on the analysis name.

    ![Select the analysis name](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/select-analysis.png " ")

10. The top boxes are a summary of the analysis:
    - 115 events were analyzed
    - 110 incidents were created <u>without</u> the compression policies enabled
    - 26 incidents would have been created <u>with</u> the compression policies enabled
    - There would have been 76% fewer incidents with compression policies enabled
    - On average, 4.42 events would have been compressed into a singular incident 

    ![Analysis summary](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/analysis-summary.png " ")

11.	View the graph for a visual breakdown of the compression: 

    - The **navy bars** represent the number of incidents when Event Compression Policies were not enabled. 
    - The **orange bars** represent number of incidents if Event Compression Policies were used. 
    - The **gray line** represents the number of real events analyzed.

    ![Analysis bar](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/analysis-bar.png " ")

13. Click on one of the bars for **Jul 22** to see the exact events mapped from incidents without compression policies to incidents with compression policies.

    ![Select one of the analysis bar](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/july-21.png " ")

14. This view allows you to see compression in action. View how multiple events that used to belong to one incident each would be grouped into a smaller number of incidents with Event Compression Policies enabled.

    ![Analysis mappings](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/analysis-map.png " ")

15. Click on the orange **Incidents with compression policies** bar to view more details.

    ![Analysis orange bar](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/orange-bar.png " ")

    ![Analysis event details](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/analysis-events.png " ")

16. Click **OK** once you are finished reviewing the details.

    ![Close analysis events](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/close-analysis-events.png " ")

17. Click **OK** again.

    ![Close analysis mappings](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/close-map.png " ")

18. Click the **X icon** to exit out of the analysis.

    ![Close analysis summary](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/close-analysis-summary.png " ")

19. Now that you have tested and confirmed your policy is working, you will publish it for use.

    **Navigate back to Setup > Incidents > Event Compression Policies**.

    ![Setup menu option](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/setup.png " ")

    ![Event Compression Policies menu option](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/event-compression-policies.png " ")

20.	Click the **Actions** icon under your policy and select **Publish**.

    ![Publish your policy](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/publish-new-policy.png " ")

    ![Select publish button](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/select-publish.png " ")

    ![Policy is now published](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/published.png " ")

21. Event Compression Policies work hand-in-hand with Incident Rules to create the incidents with compressed events. Now that your policy has been published, let’s see how it would be enabled for use in Incident Rules.

22. Navigate to **Setup > Incidents > Incident Rules**.

    ![Navigate to Setup](ask-em-images/event-compression-policies/setup.png " ")

    ![Navigate to Incident Rules](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/incident-rules.png " ")

23.	An Incident Rule Set has already been created to work with your compression policy.

24.	Select the rule set **Compress Target Down, Metric Alert, Metric Error Events**. 

    **Click Edit**.

    ![Edit the rule set](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/edit-incident-rule.png " ")

25.	Scroll down to the Rules section and view the 3 rules for:
    - Compress **Target Down Events** for Oracle Database System, Database Instance, and Pluggable Databases
    - Compress **Metric Alert Events** for Oracle Database System, Database Instance, and Pluggable Databases
    - Compress **Metric Error Events** for Oracle Database System, Database Instance, and Pluggable Databases

    ![View the multiple rules in the rule set](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/multiple-rules.png " ")

26.	Notice in the Action Summary column that all the rules Create Incidents that Use Event Compression Policies.

    ![Create incidents that use event compression policies](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/use-compression.png " ")

27.	Scroll down to the **Event Compression** section. 

28.	Notice the option, Allow policies to compress events across event types from multiple rules in the rule set (Ruleset Level Compression), has been selected. 

    This enables event compression to work across multiple event types (i.e., target availability/down, metric alert, metric evaluation error).

    ![Multiple event compression enabled](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/multi-compression-enabled.png " ")

29.	Scroll back up.

30.	Click **Cancel**.

    ![Cancel incident rule](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/cancel-rule.png " ")

31. Since your compression policy has been published, it would now work with this Incident Rule Set to compress the target down, metric alert and metric evaluation error events for your database system and its member targets into a singular incident

    ![Finalized incident rule](ask-em-images/event-compression-analysis/final-rule.png " ")
