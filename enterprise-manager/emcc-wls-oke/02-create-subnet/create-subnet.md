# Create a private subnet for load balancer services

## Introduction

In preparation for creating Kubernetes load balancer services, you will need a private subnet set up in the VCN. You can create a new subnet or use an existing private subnet. This tutorial describes how you can create a new subnet in the same VCN where the Kubernetes cluster is running.


Estimated time: 5 minutes

### Prerequisites

* Completion of the **[Migrating WebLogic Server to Kubernetes on OCI](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=567)** workshop, labs 1, 2, 3 and 4.

### Objectives
* Create a private subnet for load balancer services

## **Task 1**: Create a private subnet


1. From the Oracle Cloud navigation menu, select **Developer Services** > **Kubernetes Clusters (OKE)**.

2. Locate the compartment you created the Kubernetes cluster when you performed the prerequisite **[Migrating WebLogic Server to Kubernetes on OCI](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/workshop-attendee-2?p210_workshop_id=567&p210_type=2&session=102696148940850)** workshop. Then click the name of the VCN.

3.	In the Virtual Cloud Network Details page, click **Create Subnet**.

4. Enter the values to the fields and select options as in below:
     *	Name: **oke-wls-lb-private-subnet**
     *	Create In Compartment:  leave as default
     *	Subnet Type: **Regional**
     *	CIDR Block: **10.0.11.0/24**
     *	Route Table: select **oke-private-routable-&lt;cluster_name&gt:**
     *	Subnet Access: select **Private Subnet**
     *	DHCP options: select **Default DHCP Options for the VCN**
     *	Leave the Security List blank

   Click **Create Subnet**.

5.	In the **Virtual Cloud Network Details** page, **Subnet** section, verify that a new subnet is created. Click the link to the subnet just created.

6.	In the Subnet Details page, click **Copy** next to the OCID. Save the value to a text file. You will need this value in the next Tutorial, when create load balancer services.
