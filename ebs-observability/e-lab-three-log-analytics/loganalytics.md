# Analyzing EBS Logs

## Introduction
* In this lab, you will explore OCI Log Analytics for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) logs. Log Analytics indexes, enriches, aggregates, and correlates logs from EBS application servers, middleware, and databasesâ€”providing ML-powered dashboards and detection for rapid troubleshooting and operational insights

### Objectives

* Visualize EBS log data
* View alarms that look for specific log data
* Review out-of-box dashboards for EBS logs

## Task 1: Visualizing EBS Log Data

1. Login to the Oracle Cloud Console and change the selected region to **US East (Ashburn)** region as shown. 

     ![Selecting OCI Region](./images/setup/region-selection.png " ")

2. Click on the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Observability & Management**, and select **Log Explorer** (under the Log Analytics section). 

    ![Selecting Diagnostics and Management](./images/setup/log-analytics-nav.png " ")

3. The **root** compartment is selected by default in the Compartment field. Click on the filter icon, set the compartment to **EBS Demo** (emdemo -> eStore -> EBS_Demo), and click **Apply**.

    ![Compartment Navigation](./images/setup/log-analytics-compartment.png " ")

4. The Log Explorer allows users to query and visualize log data from various sources. By default, logs will be grouped by source in a pie chart visualization. To explore other visualizations, click the dropdown under the **Visualizations** section to the left. Click on the **Word Cloud** visualizaiton. 

    ![Log Explorer Visualizations](./images/log-explorer/word-cloud-nav.png " ")

5. This will visualize log data as a word cloud, grouped by log source. We can substitute log source with error labels. To do this, remove **Log Source** from the **Group by** input, then drag and drop the **Label** field to the **Group by** input.

    ![Log Explorer Word Cloud](./images/log-explorer/word-cloud.png " ")

6. To look into a specific error label, click on the link of that error in the table, then click **Drill down**. You can do this with any of the errors that show up.

    ![Log Explorer Word Cloud for Errors](./images/log-explorer/error-word-cloud.png " ")

7. This will provide a table of log records for that specific error. You can expand the log records to view more information.

    ![Null Pointer Log Record](./images/log-explorer/null-pointer-log-record.png " ")

8. To try out one of the ML-based visualization, clear out the query on top, and click apply. Now, click on the visualizations and select the **Issues** visualization

    ![Clearing Log Query](./images/log-explorer/empty-query.png " ")
    ![Issues Logs Navigation](./images/log-explorer/issues-nav.png " ")

9. Change the time window to **7 Days**. The Issues visualization will go through all the log records and find the following from all the collected log records:

    * Newly surfaced issues
    * Outlier log entries
    * Clusters of log regords
    * Problem sources

    ![Issues Logs](./images/log-explorer/issues.png " ")
    ![Issues Logs 7 Days](./images/log-explorer/issues-7-day.png " ")

10. Click on the count hyperlink for one of the highlighted issues to drill-down further. This will tak you to the relevant log records.

## Task 2: Automatically Detecting Error Logs

1. Navigate to the Detection Rule in Log Analytics by clicking the navigation dropdown on the top-left, then click **Administration**. In the Administration page, click on the number hyperlink under **Detection Rules**.

    ![Administration Navigation](./images/detection-rules/administration-nav.png " ")
    ![Detection Rules Navigation](./images/detection-rules/detection-rules-nav.png " ")

2. Click the **Error Id** link to open the detection rule details.

    ![Detection Rule List](./images/detection-rules/detection-rule-list.png " ")
    ![Detection Rule Details](./images/detection-rules/detection-rule.png " ")

3. To view the metric history of this detection rule, click on the **View In Metric Explorer** button. This will open a new tab in OCI Monitoring's Metric Explorer. Once the metric chart loads, change the time window to last 30 days. 

    ![Metric Explorer Navigation](./images/detection-rules/metric-explorer-nav.png " ")
    ![Metric Explorer](./images/detection-rules/metric-explorer.png " ")
    ![Metric Explorer 30 Days](./images/detection-rules/metric-explorer-30-days.png " ")

4. Return to the detection rule tab and click on the **Error ID Word Cloud** hyperlink to view the search query used for the detection rule. 

    ![Saved Search Navigation](./images/detection-rules/saved-search-nav.png " ")

5. You can view the log records retrieved from the search query by clicking the **View In Log Explorer** button.

    ![Saved Search](./images/detection-rules/saved-search.png " ")
    ![Saved Search Log Records](./images/detection-rules/saved-search-log-explorer.png " ")

*Note:* Alarms can be set up on detection rules to notify users when detection reaches a defined threshold


## Task 3: EBS Log Dashboards

1. Navigate to the Detection Rule in Log Analytics by clicking the navigation dropdown on the top-left, then click **Administration**. In the Administration page, click on the number hyperlink under **Detection Rules**.

    ![Dashboards Navigation](./images/dashboards/log-dashboard-nav.png " ")
    ![Dashboards Navigation](./images/dashboards/dashboards-list.png " ")

2. Explore the following EBS dashboards by clicking on their links:

    #### E-Business Suite Infra & Tech Stack
    ![EBS Components Dashboard](./images/dashboards/ebs-infra-dashboard.png " ")

    #### E-Business Suite - Components
    ![EBS Components Dashboard](./images/dashboards/ebs-components-dashboard.png " ")
