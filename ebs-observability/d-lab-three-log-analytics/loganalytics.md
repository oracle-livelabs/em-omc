# Analyzing EBS Logs

## Introduction
* In this lab, you will explore OCI Log Analytics for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) logs. Log Analytics indexes, enriches, aggregates, and correlates logs from EBS application servers, middleware, and databasesâ€”providing ML-powered dashboards and detection for rapid troubleshooting and operational insights

### Objectives

* Visualize EBS log data
* View alarms that look for specific log data
* Review out-of-box dashboards for EBS logs

## Task 1: Visualizing EBS Log Data

1. Login to the Oracle Cloud Console and change the selected region to **US East (Ashburn)** region as shown. 

     ![Selecting OCI Region](./images/setup/region-selection.png " ")

2. Click on the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Observability & Management**, and select **Log Explorer** (under the Log Analytics section). 

    ![Selecting Diagnostics and Management](./images/setup/log-analytics-nav.png " ")

3. The **root** compartment is selected by default in the Compartment field. Click on the filter icon, set the compartment to **EBS Demo** (emdemo -> eStore -> EBS_Demo), and click **Apply**.

    ![Compartment Navigation](./images/setup/log-analytics-compartment.png " ")

4. The Log Explorer allows users to query and visualize log data from various log sources. By default, logs will be grouped by source in a pie chart visualization. To explore other visualizations, click the dropdown under the **Visualizations** section to the left. Click on the **Word Cloud** visualizaiton. 

    ![Log Explorer Visualizations](./images/log-explorer/word-cloud-nav.png " ")

5. This will visualize log data as a word cloud, grouped by log source. In our case, we want to see a word cloud of the errors that show up in the logs. To do this, we can substitute log source with error labels. Remove **Log Source** from the **Group by** input, then drag and drop the **Label** field to the **Group by** input.

    ![Log Explorer Word Cloud](./images/log-explorer/word-cloud.png " ")

6. To look into a specific error label, click on the link of that error in the table, then click **Drill down**. You can do this with any of the errors that show up.

    ![Log Explorer Word Cloud for Errors](./images/log-explorer/error-word-cloud.png " ")

7. This will provide a histogram of the log record occurance for that specific error, along with a table of the log records that were collected. You can expand the log records to view all the fields that were parsed from the log files. Log Analytics does this parsing automatically for many sources, including EBS and WebLogic logs.

    ![Null Pointer Log Record](./images/log-explorer/null-pointer-log-record.png " ")

## Task 2: ML-Based Log Analysis

1. There are powerful machine-learning visualization in Log Analytics which can help with identifying issues from all the logs collected. To view the ML-based visualization, clear out the query on top, and click **Run**. Then click on the visualizations and select the **Issues** visualization.

    ![Clearing Log Query](./images/ml-analysis/empty-query.png " ")
    ![Issues Logs Navigation](./images/ml-analysis/issues-nav.png " ")

2. Change the time window to **7 Days**. The Issues visualization will go through all the log records and categorize the logs in the following ways:

    * Newly surfaced issues
    * Outlier log entries

    ![Issues Logs](./images/ml-analysis/issues.png " ")
    ![Issues Logs 7 Days](./images/ml-analysis/issues-7-day.png " ")

3. Click on the **Count** hyperlink for one of the highlighted issues to drill-down further. This will tak you to the relevant log records for further exploration.

    ![Issues Logs Drilldown Navigation](./images/ml-analysis/issue-drilldown-nav.png " ")
    ![Issues Logs Drilldown](./images/ml-analysis/issue-drilldown.png " ")

4. Next, we will create a linked view across various log fields. Click on the the visualizations and select the **Link** visualization.

    ![Link Visualization Navigation](./images/ml-analysis/link-visualization-nav.png " ")

5. Drag and drop the **Label** and **Problem Priority** fields into the **Group by** box, then click **Apply**. This will create a linked view accross the 3 fields selected. To drill down into the individual log records for a given row item, click on the **Count** hyperlink for that row.

    ![Link Visualization Setup](./images/ml-analysis/link-visualization-setup.png " ")
    ![Link Visualization](./images/ml-analysis/link-visualization.png " ")

6. Finally, we will look at the Cluster visualization, which uses clustering algorithms to group log data. Click on the the visualizations and select the **Cluster** visualization.

    ![Cluster Visualization Navigation](./images/ml-analysis/cluster-visualization-nav.png " ")

7. Select the **Show Problem Logs Only** checkbox, to focus on problematic logs. To drill down into the individual log records for a given cluster, click on the **Count** hyperlink for that row.

    ![Cluster Visualization](./images/ml-analysis/cluster-visualization.png " ")

## Task 3: Automatically Detecting Error Logs

1. Log Analyics allows users to save log queries and use them for custom dashboard visualization. Users can also create rules to detect when a saved log query returns results for a given time window (eg. check every 5 minutes). Let's explore a detection rule by clicking the navigation dropdown on the top-left and selecting **Administration**. In the Administration page, click on the number hyperlink under **Detection Rules**.

    ![Administration Navigation](./images/detection-rules/administration-nav.png " ")
    ![Detection Rules Navigation](./images/detection-rules/detection-rules-nav.png " ")

2. Click the **Error Id** link to open the detection rule details. This detection rule has been set up to look for errors in the log data. 

    ![Detection Rule List](./images/detection-rules/detection-rule-list.png " ")
    ![Detection Rule Details](./images/detection-rules/detection-rule.png " ")

3. To view the metric history of this detection rule, click on the **View In Metric Explorer** button. This will open a new tab in OCI Monitoring's Metric Explorer. Once the metric chart loads, change the time window to last 30 days. The chart shows the number of error log occurrences for the past 30 days. 
    
    *Note:* Alarms can be set up on detection rules to notify users when detection reaches a defined threshold. In this case, it can either be for the total number of occurrences of errors, or the number of occurrences for a specific error.

    ![Metric Explorer Navigation](./images/detection-rules/metric-explorer-nav.png " ")
    ![Metric Explorer](./images/detection-rules/metric-explorer.png " ")
    ![Metric Explorer 30 Days](./images/detection-rules/metric-explorer-30-days.png " ")

4. Return to the detection rule tab and click on the **Error ID Word Cloud** hyperlink to view the saved search query used for the detection rule. 

    ![Saved Search Navigation](./images/detection-rules/saved-search-nav.png " ")

5. You can view the log records retrieved from the search query by clicking the **View In Log Explorer** button.

    *Note:* Saved search queries can be imported into custom dashboards and would show up as widgets that mimic the visualization in Log Analytics

    ![Saved Search](./images/detection-rules/saved-search.png " ")
    ![Saved Search Log Records](./images/detection-rules/saved-search-log-explorer.png " ")



## Task 4: EBS Log Dashboards

1. Log Analytics provides EBS-specific dashboards that can help with monitoring the health of EBS stack component, Concurrent Processing, and WorkFlow Notification Mailer.

    ![Dashboards Navigation](./images/dashboards/log-dashboard-nav.png " ")
    ![Dashboards Navigation](./images/dashboards/dashboards-list.png " ")

2. Explore the following EBS dashboards and ensure the correct compartment is selected:

    #### E-Business Suite Infra & Tech Stack
    ![EBS Components Dashboard](./images/dashboards/ebs-infra-dashboard.png " ")

    #### E-Business Suite - Components
    ![EBS Components Dashboard](./images/dashboards/ebs-components-dashboard.png " ")
