# Visibility into the EBS Stack

## Introduction

In this lab, you will explore OCI Stack Monitoring for an Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) environment. Stack Monitoring provides a unified, fullâ€‘stack view of your EBS environment by gathering key health metrics, and surfacing anomalies for proactive issue detection and resolution.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

* Use Stack Monitoring to view resources, availability, and metrics for EBS components
* Explore Monitoring Templates & Alarms
* View data for user-defined Metric Extensions

## Task 1: EBS Resources Dashboard

1. Click on the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Observability & Management**, and select **Stack Monitoring**.

     ![Selecting Stack Monitoring](./images/setup/stack-monitoring-nav.png " ")

2. The **root** compartment is selected by default in the Compartment field. Set the compartment to **EBS Demo** (emdemo -> eStore -> EBS_Demo).

     ![Compartment Navigation](./images/setup/stack-mon-compartment.png " ")

3. In the Enterprise Summary page, you can view EBS resource status, metrics, and triggered alarms.

     ![Enterprise Summary Page](./images/ebs-resources/enterprise-summary.png " ")

4. To view the currently triggered alarms, click on the number hyperlink under the **Alarms** widget.

     ![Navigating to Triggered Alarms](./images/ebs-resources/all-alarms-nav.png " ")

5. The window provides a summary table of all the **Critical** and **Warning** alarms that are currently firing, along with the resource and metric details. Click on one of the hyperlinks under the Alarm Name column.

     ![Alarms Window](./images/ebs-resources/all-alarms.png " ")

6. This opens the Alarm Defenition page, where it provides the alarm details, along with the historical data for that alarm.

     ![Alarm Definition Page](./images/ebs-resources/alarm-definition.png " ")

## Task 2: Viewing EBS Resource Details

1. To view the list of discovered resources for this environment, click on **All Resources** on the left pane.

     ![Navigating to All Resources](./images/ebs-resources/all-resources-nav.png " ")

2. Click on the **EBS Demo ConcurrentProcessing** resource.

     ![All Resources Page](./images/ebs-resources/all-resources.png " ")

3. The Resource Details page provides triggered alarms for that resource, availability history, and key metric charts.

     ![Resource Details](./images/ebs-resources/resource-details.png " ")
     ![Resource Metrics](./images/ebs-resources/resource-metrics.png " ")

3. To view the alarms that are triggered by this resource, click **Alarms** on the left pane.
     ![Resource Alarms Navigation](./images/ebs-resources/resource-alarms-nav.png " ")
     ![Resource Alarms](./images/ebs-resources/resource-alarms.png " ")

4. A topology view is also available for each resource and can be accessed by clicking **Topology** on the left pane.
     ![Resource Topology](./images/ebs-resources/resource-topology.png " ")

## Task 3: Templates for Alarms and Thresholds

1. Use the breadcrum link on the top-left of the page to navigate back to Stack Monitoring.

     ![Navigating Back to Stack Monitoring](./images/ebs-resources/stack-mon-nav.png " ")

2. Click on Monitoring Templates on the left pane. This will provide a list of templates that can be automatically applied to discovered resources. Uncheck the *Include Oracle certified templates* checkbox in order to view the applied templates.

     ![All Monitoring Templates](./images/monitoring-templates/monitoring-templates-list.png " ")

3. Uncheck the *Include Oracle certified templates* checkbox in order to view the applied templates only.

     ![Applied Monitoring Templates](./images/monitoring-templates/monitoring-templates-filtered-list.png " ")

3. Click on the **E-Business Suite Oracle-Certified Clone**. This provides a table of pre-defined alarm conditions that are specific to EBS. Each row item outlines the following:

     * **Metric**: Metric name
     * **Interval**: Cadence at which the metric is collected
     * **Statistic**: Statistical operation to apply to the metric values
     * **Operator**: Comparison operator to apply for the thresholds
     * **Warning Threshold**: Value at which an alarm with Warning serverity is triggered
     * **Critical Threshold**: Value at which an alarm with Critical serverity is triggered

     ![EBS Monitoring Template](./images/monitoring-templates/ebs-monitoring-template.png " ")

     *Note:* Alarm notifications can be configured to send notifications through the following channels:
          * Email
          * SMS
          * HTTPS Webhook
          * OCI Functions (to trigger code execution)
          * PagerDuty
          * Slack

4. To view other Monitoring Templates that are enabled for this EBS environment, click **Close** on the bottom-left and select a different template.

     **WebLogic Server Monitoring Template**

     ![WLS Monitoring Template](./images/monitoring-templates/wls-monitoring-template.png " ")

     **Host Monitoring Template**

     ![Host Monitoring Template](./images/monitoring-templates/host-monitoring-template.png " ")

     **Container DB Monitoring Template**

     ![CDB Monitoring Template](./images/monitoring-templates/cdb-monitoring-template.png " ")


## Task 4: Custom Metrics from EBS Resources

1. To view user-defined metrics which Stack Monitoring collects, click on the **Metric Extensions** link on the left pane.

     ![Metric Extensions](./images/metric-extensions/metric-extensions.png " ")

2. Click on the Metric Extension named **ME_LRConcRequest1m**

     Stack Monitoring allows users to collect custom metrics from discovered resources. In our case, we are collecting a Metric from the EBS database. The following are needed in order to create a metric extension:

     * Resource
     * Collection method - In our case, we use an SQL query
     * Collection frequency
     * Mapping of metrics and dimensions

     ![Long Running Concurrent Request Metric Extension](./images/metric-extensions/long-running-conc-requests.png " ")

3. You can also choose a time period from the last **60 minutes, 24 hours, or 7 days** to view the metrics.

     ![Time Selection](./images/select-more-time.png " ")

4. Click **Close** on the bottom to exit the Metric Extension details panel.
